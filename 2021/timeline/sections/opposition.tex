		TransCanada & "Dear Owner: You by now are aware that TransCanada [...] is constructing and will operate a 2,833 mile crude oil pipeline [...]. As you know, the path of the pipeline will cross a portion of your property. In order to construct the pipeline, Keystone must acquire a permanent and temporary easement over your property. It is Keystone's strong preference to negotiate a voluntary transfer with each property owner. However, in the event we cannot come to an agreement, Keystone will use eminent domain to acquire the easement, which is authorized pursuant to Nebraska Revised statute § 57-1101 et. seq." \citep{TransCanada2010}.\\

		Nebraska landowner & "And the more I checked it out, the more I found it was an issue worth fighting for. TransCanada told us we can either deal with their negotiators or deal with their attorneys. I said, ‘Bring it on. For a few thousand dollars, you’re not going to scare us’"--Randy Thompson, farmer, in 2010 on TransCanada's request for an easement.\parnote{\url{https://insideclimatenews.org/news/12102010/some-nebraska-landowners-wont-make-way-for-oil-sands-pipeline/}}\\

		Dr. James Hansen & "President George W. Bush said that the U.S. was addicted to oil. So what will the U.S. response to this situation be? Will it entail phasing out fossil fuels and moving to clean energy or borrowing the dirtiest needle from a fellow addict? That is the question facing President Obama. If he chooses the dirty needle it is game over because it will confirm that Obama was just greenwashing, like the other well-oiled coal-fired politicians with no real intention of solving the addiction".\parnote{\url{https://insideclimatenews.org/news/29082011/james-hansen-nasa-climate-change-scientist-keystone-xl-oil-sands-pipeline-protests-mckibben-white-house/}}\\
