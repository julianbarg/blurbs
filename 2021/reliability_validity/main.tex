	% \section*{Reliability and validity in organizational learning}

	% This section provides a brief literature review of the existing work on reliability and validity.

	% \section*{Methods}

	% This section introduces which literature was used to develop the ideas that are introduced subsequently.

	% \section*{Findings}

	% This section works twofold. First, it lays out the processes of (un)reliable and (in)valid learning in clear terms. Then, the material from the methods section are used to show the processes in action and develop additional concepts. For instance, provide examples of invalid but reliable learning on a societal or organizational scale and show how the situation came to be. This section will be developed through additional tables on the literature that was introduced in the methods section. I have previously developed some of these tables, but have sighted additional literature with a critical view that now needs to be integrated (see \url{http://wiki.jbarg.net/Constructivism%20%26%20Ecology}).

	\section*{Conclusion}

	Just a summary? Spelling out implications for sustainability seems construed? Implications for different fields maybe?
