\subsection*{Data on the pipeline industry}

The studies are informed by three datasets on the pipeline industry that I have collected in preparation of the dissertation research. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) is the preeminent source of quantitative data on the pipeline industry in the US. PHMSA provides data on pipeline miles and the volume of oil transported (in gallon-miles) by operator every year. PHMSA also maintains a repository on every pipeline spill in the US. This repository includes the data we need to carry out study one--the location, volume, cause, and a narrative of every of the over 100 significant spills (>50 gallon, or meeting one of three other conditions) that occur in the US every year.

In addition, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) provides in-depth narratives of a small number of noteworthy pipeline incidents over an extended period of time. The NTSB uses its own resources to investigates these incidents and provides in-depth reports of usually 10-70 pages as well as shorter briefs. Since 1996, the NTSB has completed 53 investigations on pipeline incidents. These incidents provide an understanding of both the organizational and technological causes of pipeline spills \citep[cf.][]{Perrow1984}.
