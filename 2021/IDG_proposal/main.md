# Science, industry, and the public: The policy battle over fossil fuel infrastructure

## I. Objectives

In response to increasing concern about the unsustainable use of environmental resources, scientists are turning to diverse forms of activism [@Malm2020; @Mann2020; @Ripple2017; @Vogt2021; @Smerlak2022]. Citing evidence that we risk overstepping the boundaries for a safe planet, activist scientists argue that we should use scientific and technical knowledge to develop more effective policy [@Sterner2019]. Their activism confronts two conflicting developments. One development has been cause for hope: sustainability has gone mainstream [@Lyon2018]. As of 2020, ninety percent of S&P 500 global companies issue sustainability reports, up from only twenty percent in 2011 [@Peterson2021]. Corporations have developed voluntary codes of conduct to deal with environmental problems [@Lyon2018]. The second development is cause for concern. Action to mitigate human effects on climate repeatedly lags our ambitions for progress [@Rogelj2016; @Schleussner2016]. Even the most optimistic of estimates now find these corporate sustainability efforts "wholly insufficient" to overcome corporate effects on the environment [@Lyon2018]. Worse, activist scientists such as the members of Scientist Rebellion--which includes the Nobel Laureate Jacques Dubochet--warn that companies in the fossil fuel industry and in other industrial sectors are pressuring governments into inaction [@Vogt2021].

Sustainability scholars have focused primarily on the first of these developments, in the hope that firms can embrace sustainability and find ways to do well by doing good [@Battilana2010]. Yet, recent research suggests that corporate claims about their sustainability practices may be little more than greenwashing: misleading communications about environmental practices or products intended to give the impression of action [@Lyon2015]. Even more concerning, corporations may be using their rhetoric about sustainability to hide efforts to shape policy, rather than simply respond to it [@Schendler2021].

That possibility of firms shaping policy has received only limited attention in organizational research. The greenwashing literature assumes that firms respond to policy with a rhetoric of conformity, effectively severing the link between policy and practice [c.f. @Bromley2012]. But decoupling is not the only response to external pressure. Firms may also defy, manipulate, contest, or even reshape external demands [@Oliver1991]. Yet surprisingly, corporate efforts to target public policy have received almost no scholarly attention in the organizational literature [@Barley2010]. Here we will use the oil pipeline industry as a setting to address that limitation. We will study how fossil fuel companies mobilize resources to shape sustainability policy.

Corporate influences on environmental policy may go beyond direct efforts to shape policy, however. As scientists seek to shape policy in accordance with climate change research they encounter fossil fuel companies that shape public perception around climate policy, often in hidden or subtle ways [@Fang2017; @Schendler2021; @Aronczyk2022]. The relationships between policy, practice, and climate change outcomes is hard to trace [@Bromley2012; @Wijen2014]. Even well-established means such as carbon capture or biofuels may not lead to the expected ends [@Anderson2016; @Lane2021; @Tilman2009]. Indirect efforts to undermine effective policy capitalize on this ambiguity and confusion [cf. @Cappellaro2021]. These tactics shift influence away from the experts, the policy makers, and the decision makers to the ordinary citizen [@Aronczyk2022]. Here we seek to situate the efforts of activist scientists in these dynamics of indirect influence as it emerges in both national and local settings.

Our goal is to conjoin the literatures on climate change, greenwashing, and the role of corporations in policy making with the aim of developing insights on the disconnect between climate science and industrial practice. We have two main objectives:

> **Objective one--Identify and catalogue the range of lobbying actions used to shape environmental policy decisions around North American oil infrastructure.**

> **Objective two--Develop a model of direct and indirect influence in the interaction between science, industry, and the public around issues of climate-change policy.**

Overall, our research explores how fossil fuel companies exert influence on environmental policy. Our model on the interaction between science, industry, and the public will provide climate scientists and organizational scholars with a better understanding of why findings are not translated into practice. The answers to our research questions have important implications for (a) theory development in the greenwashing and institutional theory literatures, (b) for scholars who seek to translate findings into practice, (c) for local residents, policy makers, environmental groups, and other stakeholders who may be affected by fossil fuel infrastructure construction, and (d) federal policy on environmental resource use in Canada.

## II. Context

### Objective one: Direct influence on policy outcomes

At the core of our research is the gap between the rhetoric and reality of corporate climate action. Numerous developments demonstrate that sustainability is no longer a fringe issue. Managers increasingly face shareholder pressure around climate change concerns [@Flammer2021]. Thousands of companies have signed up to the UN Global Compact to tackle human rights concerns, environmental degradation, corruption and other issues. [@Lyon2018]. Corporations have even begun to develop their own codes of conduct rather than to wait on government action [@Vogt2007]. While these initiatives produce tangible environmental benefits [@Lyon2018], scientists point out they are insufficient. Our aggregate climate change trajectory does not meet the ambitions of the Paris accord [@Rogelj2016; @Schleussner2016] and "even [the] most optimistic scenario is insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 'well below' 2 Â°C" [@Sognnaes2021].

The existing literature argues the gap is due corporate claims simply being "greenwashing." Corporations use the selective disclosure of positive information [@Lyon2011]--or even outright lies [@Lyon2015]--to signal a commitment to sustainability. Those claims may not be backed up by action [@Bowen2014] but they allow firms to decouple their internal practices from external policy expectations [@Bromley2012]. The effectiveness of such symbolic management is unclear, however [@Lyon2015]--effective policy and increased transparency may be one means to defeat greenwashing [@Lyon2018].

Symbolic management practices like greenwashing are not the only corporate response to external pressure, however. Firms may reshape policy to serve their own interests [@Barley2010]. For example, the climate scientist Michael Mann argues that over the past thirty years fossil fuel companies have sought to delay action on climate change [@Mann2012; @Mann2020]. Similarly, U.S. Senator Sheldon [@Whitehouse2016] has accused oil companies of "playing a double game: trying to buy a little credibility with [their] public comments while using all their quiet lobbying muscle to crush any threat of bipartisan action on the carbon pricing they claim to espouse." If this view is correct, then corporations may be proposing self-regulation to avert more rigorous government standards [@Vogel2005; @Barnett2008; @Lyon2018]. Policies and practices like carbon offset, carbon capture and storage, or net-zero homes may be diversionary tactics [@Schendler2021] while corporate campaign contributions seek to prevent serious environmental regulations [@Schendler2011].

If scientists are right in claiming that we have the tools to design effective sustainability policy [see @Sterner2019], then the barriers to implementing policy change may be the corporate lobbying of fossil fuel companies. We know that large-scale lobbying, political, and campaign financing efforts are a significant reality of corporate behavior [@Salles-Djelic2017]. Yet such lobbying efforts have received surprisingly little attention in the management literature [@Barley2010]. Here we are interested in the ways that firms directly intervene in policy making to subvert policies they consider hostile to their interests--for example, efforts by activists to stop pipeline projects. We want to understand how corporations insert themselves into the policy-making process. What tools and practices do they use to directly shape policy that might limit their activities? What sorts of lobbying, persuasion, and campaign-financing practices do they follow? What policy-makers do they engage? How do they engage them?

### Objective two: Indirect influence in the policy battle

Objective one assumes that firms respond to their external environment by focusing on policy makers. However, organizations are "both the implements of societies and [...] institutions which shape the societies" [@Hickson1980: 2]. Firms may seek to shape policy directly, but they may also shape the political and social environment within which policy is made [@Barley2010]. Efforts to shape the environment go beyond reacting to public policy. Corporations have assembled a network of organizations to shape their external environment, including public relations firms [@Aronczyk2019; @Aronczyk2022], political action committes, law firms and lobbying organizations [@Barley2010], think tanks [@Djelic2017; @Djelic2020], and ad hoc community mobilization [@Jerolmack2018]. The institutional structure that has emerged is heavily tilted in favor of business. For example, in the 1970s the field of think tanks was largely nonpartisan. Now 86 percent of think tanks act on behalf of businesses, 7 percent represent occupations, and the remaining 7 percent represent the rest of the population [@Barley2010].

Both organizational scholars and sustainability scholars have only recently begun to address the potential significance of this institutional structure. Sustainability research focuses primarily on how corporations may shape society for good, but neglects the harm they may do [@Ergene2020]. Yet fossil fuel companies frequently undermine sustainability efforts through public relations firms that influence the political and social support for environmental policy [@Aronczyk2019; @Aronczyk2022]. The tactics are often either hidden or subtle. For example, the CEOs of Dow Chemical and Corning made a public call in the Wall Street Journal for the United States to remain in the Paris Agreement; meanwhile, they used intermediaries to encourage the Trump administration to withdraw [@Fang2017]. BP used even more subtle tactics in hiring Ogilvy & Mather to promote the carbon footprint as a measure of impact on climate change. The metric made climate action an individual responsibility, allowing BP to claim it had reduced its own carbon footprint even as its business and associated policies and practices contribute greatly to the problems of climate change [@Doyle2011].

These subversive efforts mean that direct engagement with policy makers in support of scientifically proven policy tools [@Sterner2019] are a necessary, but not sufficient condition for advancing good policy. Effective climate policy requires attending to the science but also to direct and especially to indirect effects on the policy arena. Relationships between climate change policy, climate change practice, and climate change outcomes are often hard to trace, so the means and ends can also become decoupled [@Bromley2012; @Wijen2014]. Even well-established means such as carbon capture or biofuels may not lead to the expected ends of mitigating climate change [@Anderson2016; @Lane2021; @Tilman2009]. Public relations firms recognize that if the scientific facts around climate change are ambiguous, then influence shifts away from experts, policy makers, and decision makers, to ordinary people [@Aronczyk2022]. This means that scientists seeking to change policy may need to shift their arena of engagement beyond experts and policy makers. One approach is to rally ordinary people around their local concerns in local settings [@Dokshin2016; @Vasi2015; @Jerolmack2018]. In addition to the direct efforts to influence policy, local mobilization requires indirect work to shape public perceptions and the political environment around policy.

Here we propose to study these dynamics of indirect influence as they shape the perception of public policy at both the national and the local level. We will attend to those supporting environmental efforts but also to those opposing it. We will begin with the policy concerns of climate scientists, but we propose to situate those concerns in broader social and political dynamics, focusing on what tactics are effect in shifting perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs about climate science, climate concerns, and climate policy.

**Link to scholars' ongoing research.** This research bridges the prior research of Principal Investigator and established scholar Dr. Mark Zbaracki, and of Co-investigator and emerging scholar Dr. Wren Montgomery. The new research will build on the recent research program of established scholar Dr. Mark Zbaracki in the area of interorganizational learning and politics [@Rerup2021; Maslach2018], and on his award-winning work on rhetoric [@Zbaracki1998]. Dr. Wren contributes her expertise on greenwashing [@Lyon2013; @Lyon2015], which represents the point of departure of this new research. Her 2015 article remains the highest-cited review on the subject [@Lyon2015]. She has also embarked on a research program on public water supply in the US, at the intersection of materiality, business interests, and political dynamics [@Montgomery2020b; @Montgomery2018; @Zhao2019], based on her award-winning dissertation research. From these points of departure, we take on the topic of climate change and post-truth politics, anchoring the research in materiality through pipelines.

<!-- ### Contributions -->
</br>

**Contributions.** Our research follows a long tradition in organizational theory that looks at how firms respond to their external environment and contributes to theory development, to the policy environment, and to the public interest:
    
* Our research directly responds to two recent calls for research on corporate influence, one calling for organizational research showing how corporations use an institutional field built to amplify corporate influence [e.g. @Barley2010], and a second calling for research on how the public policy activities by firms affects sustainability concerns [@Lyon2018].
* By building a model that catalogues the ways that fossil fuel companies directly and indirectly influence policy around pipeline infrastructure, our research goes beyond the current focus on symbolic management practices like greenwashing [@Lyon2015] and focuses on the use of political influence around the means and ends of sustainability practice.
* Our focus on policy interventions that are grounded in science helps policy makers anticipate the challenges in using scientific knowledge to shape better policy around sustainability.
* Finally, our focus on fossil-fuel infrastructure has important implications for the public good, because it has direct effects on one of the most urgent problems of our time, climate change.

## III. Methodology

We will conduct our research in two phases. In phase one we conduct a mixed quantitative and qualitative methods study [@Edmondson2007] on the policy concerns around oil infrastructure in the United States. In phase two, we carry out a qualitative study on the disputes over two most controversial oil infrastructure projects of the 2010s: Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline. We choose oil pipelines as it allows us to anchor our analysis in a specific construction project or "object of concern" [@Latour2005]. The anchoring allows us to begin with the material object of the pipeline and catalogue all the interests and concerns that it evokes. Oil pipelines stand in for the broader context of the fossil fuel industry. They are also critical bottlenecks to fossil fuel production and consumption. Focusing on oil pipelines allow us to contrast instances where oil pipelines continue to enjoy policy support--the Dakota Access Pipeline--and instances where oil pipelines have been rejected--the Keystone XL project. Pipelines are partially built on public lands and hence the first to be affected by a changing political landscape. Projects such as Keystone XL, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion have faced sharp public resistance, including from outspoken scholars [@Cheon2018]. Meanwhile, the pipeline industry wields power in a policy arena where national policy is decoupled from science [@Palen2014]. Finally, oil pipelines have important implications for Canada, because they are the means of taking natural resources to a broader market.

**Phase 1: Direct lobbying efforts.** In the first phase, we will develop a model cataloguing the policy concerns around pipelines. We will first gather quantitative data on pipeline miles; pipeline throughput; and the locations of major reserves, refineries, and ports. We will also collect data on environmental impacts from the construction of new pipelines, from oil spills, and regular emissions. Most of the data is GIS data which we will visualize using ggmap [@Kahle2013] and shiny [@Chang2021] to obtain interactive maps. This quantitative data will be used to contextualize qualitative data, to support interviews with informants, and to assess the relevance of our findings.

For our qualitative analysis, we will use news stories on fossil fuel infrastructure from the four American newspapers of records, obtained from the Factiva database, and industry publications like the Oil & Gas Journal. We will code this data for relevant events and direct influence tactics, looking for three kinds of events: (1) legislative assembly meetings and (2) public hearings where firms can influence the opinion of politicians as well as (3) challenges of existing permits through enforcement actions or public discourse. We will then collect interview data in locations where policy is set--in particular, where oil companies and pipelines have headquarters. The goal of this work is a model cataloguing all direct influence tactics, grounded in the microfoundations of a specific empirical context [cf. @Reinecke2021].

**Phase 2: Indirect influence in the policy battle.** In the second phase, we turn to indirect influence strategies. We will "zoom in" [@Nicolini2009] and observe interactions and industry, scientific, and public discourse on two specific pipeline projects: Keystone XL and Dakota Access. We first widen the range of events that we attend to by creating an event-history database from reports by the three major news agencies: Agence France-Presse, Associated Press, and Reuters. Relevant events may range from benign events such as a strategic lawsuits against legislation--intended to delay proceedings--to violent clashes between protesters, construction workers, and the police. We will then expand our dataset by following up on government dockets with meeting minutes; press releases by pipeline operators and construction companies; and posts on social media platforms where actors voice their concerns, plan their actions, and report events from their point of view. In this phase we will look for interactions between fossil fuel companies and their intermediaries; politicians; the public; and scientists. We will then triangulate our data by interviewing key participants in the process at sites where the disputes have occurred, including Washington DC, but especially in locations like Lincoln, Nebraska (and the environs) where disputes over pipeline policy have erupted. The goal of this phase of the research is a comprehensive model of the dynamics of indirect influence on pipeline outcomes.
