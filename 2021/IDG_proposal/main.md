# Anthropocene: technical and social dimension

## Introduction

We have entered the Anthropocene. We are no longer simply passive observers of the natural world [@Lewis2015]. Instead, we live in a human-dominated geological epoch in which we can no longer maintain a separation between Human and Nature [@Latour2015]. In the face of droughts in California [@AghaKouchak2015], the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event [@Hughes2019], and dwindling insect bio mass [@Hallmann2017], the consequences of the Anthropocene have become hard to ignore [@Sterner2019]. Having recognized that the problem is more than technical, [@Heffernan2011; @Ripple2017], scientists have turned to diverse forms of activism [ @Thompson2021; @Ripple2017; @Vogt2021; @Malm2020], seeking to use their scientific and technical knowledge to develop policy that will hold firms accountable for their practices.

Their efforts face two significant institutional roadblocks. First, firms have strategic reasons for resisting these policies. Firms have already been shown to engage in symbolic responses such as greenwashing: producing communication that misleads people about the extent of their environmental practices or products [@Lyon2015]. Such resistance means that their practices will become decoupled from otherwise sound policy [@Bromley2012]. A robust literature has shown the range of ways that firms engage in such decoupling, from long-term incentive plans that are formally adopted but never really implemented to formally independent boards of directors that are buddy-buddy with the CEO [@Westphal2020b]. But firms also have options even before policy has been decided. As Oliver (1991) argues, they may also defy, contest, manipulate, or reshape the institutional expectations. To understand how policy relates to practice, we need to consider how firms seek to decouple policy from practice through the implementation process.

Objective 1: Develop a model of the dynamics of policy and practice negotiations given the conflicting technical and institutional forces in dealing with the problems of the Anthropocene. 

The problem of policy responses may be more pernicious than a simple decoupling of policy from practice [@Bromley2012], however. Activist scientists seeking to avert problems of the Anthropocene like climate change may pursue sound policy based on their scientific understanding, but climate change is shaped in arenas beyond science, policy, and business [c.f. @Latour2004]. A scientific world view depends on a clear relationship between actions and outcomes, but in many arenas, the implications of action on sound policy may be less clear. This leads to a second form of decoupling, means-end decoupling, in which actions and policies are clearly articulated, but the links to climate-change outcomes are ambiguous [@Bromley2012]. For example, when social activism enters the arenas, the actions may have only an ambiguous relationship to the problem of climate change. **>>We need an example; I am thinking of your protestors here.<<** In other arenas, actors may actively undermine the claims of science--for example, through climate-change denial **>>(need example)<<**. This form of decoupling goes beyond ceremonial conformity and contestation over legitimate policy, and instead undermines the causal claims that support policy. To understand these dynamics, we need to consider a different form of decoupling, we need to consider arenas beyond science, policy, and industry.

Objective 2: What different arenas are their around climate change activity and how do the claims actors make change depending on what arena they are in?

### Objective 1: How does policy emerge given competing technical and institutional imperatives.

Scientists have begun to turn activist in the face of a growing body of scientific and technical evidence demonstrating the urgency of problems like climate change. Their efforts face two forms of institutional resistance. The most commonly studied form is what is known as greenwashing: the intentional production of overly positive communication by firms about their environmental practices [@Lyon2015].  Greenwashing is an example of policy-practice decoupling that allows firms to adopt conflicting policies in response to external pressure without substantively changing ongoing practice [@Bromley2012]. Such symbolic management--the use of either language or practice to appear legitimate [@Westphal2020]--can be found in a variety of domains: corporate directors [@Shi2018]; corporate philanthropy [@Cuypers2016]; corporate governance [@Westphal2016]; and strategic change [@Mantere2012].

But ceremonial conformity to institutional pressures is not the only response to external pressures. For example, Volkswagen manipulated both the emissions systems and the software of its automobiles [@Siano2017]. As @Oliver1991 points out, firms can also defy, manipulate, contest, or even reshape institutional pressures. By defying, contesting, and reshaping policy, firms can soften policy demands because policy makers must take into account what firms will accept. For example, in the 2015 Paris Agreement around climate change, the negotiations "eloquently demonstrated the futility of technical negotiations, without political consensus on the core elements and features of the new agreement" [@Savaresi2016: 16]. The resulting reality of actual practice: pledges for action repeatedly lag ambitions for limiting global warming [@Rogelj2016; @Schleussner2016]. Of course, policy makers are not without tools in this dynamic. For example, [@Haack2021] develop a model in which policy makers first lure firms with easy standards and then, through increased transparency, bring them into compliance over time. **>>Aronczyk’s research?<<** But our research on the relationship between policy and practice needs to take into account this dynamic between the technical imperatives of the Anthropocene and the institutional realities of changing policy. 

Here we are interested in those institutional dynamics as legislation on climate action is negotiated, written, and contested on the regional, national, and international scale. Just as scientists may enter the policy scene as climate activists, so industry representatives may also insert themselves into the process either as individuals or organizations as intermediaries. We will focus on the unfolding dynamic between the technical and institutional imperatives as industry representatives engage activist scientists and policy makers. How do industry actors and allies insert themselves into the different stages of policy making? What tools do industry actors and allies have at their disposal to construct institutional imperatives? How do industry actor and allies develop or influence technical knowledge? How does corporate political action shape unfolding policy *before* engaging in symbolic conformity?

### Objective 2: How does the landscape of action in the Anthropocene vary depending on the how actors in different arenas encounter each other?

The research on decoupling activities like greenwashing [@Lyon2015] treats the problem as one of firms resisting effective policy. But decoupling can also occur when firms do follow the policies, but the proposed practices cannot achieve the desired outcomes [@Bromley2012]. This second form of decoupling can originate in a range of arenas [@Latour2004], often far beyond the nexus of science, policy, and firm practice that we typically study. The problems may involve the assumptions of science, but they may emerge through the divergent concerns of other audiences with their own views of effective policy and action: activists, advocates, the larger public, and even those who deny the problems of the Anthropocene.

To arrive at a more complete understanding of the relationship between policy and practice, we need to set the evolving policy debate in a broader social context. Our second objective therefore considers four related problems. First, even within the policy arena, the means-ends relationships may be unclear. For example, both carbon capture policies **>>(citation?)<<** and policies promoting biofuels [@Lyon2015] are common policy responses to global warming that may not actually improve climate change outcomes. Instead, they reflect a common problem with policy addressing problems of the Anthropocene: they are symbols of our desire to believe that we are taking action, regardless of whether the action is truly effective. Such policies reflect an additional aspect of greenwashing: it is not always committed just by firms and it may be unintentional [@Nemes2021]. Sometimes we want to believe that our policies will work, even when they do not.

Second, implementing and acting on climate change policy requires broad public support. That support is not always forthcoming, however, as commitments for the Copenhagen accord [cf. @Schussler2014], the Kyoto protocol **>>(need citations)<<** and, most recently, the Paris 'pledge and review' approach all have fallen short of their ambitions [@Rogelj2016; @Schleussner2016]. Unfortunately, the problems of garnering public support run up against a broad-based ignorance about appropriate action. Research shows that there are widely held--but often invalid--understandings about how different actions contribute to global warming. Common-sense and intuition offer poor guidance on even basic issues like the energy usage of heating and air conditioning [@Attari2010] or the emissions associated with a burger vis-à-vis a salad [@Camilleri2019].

Third, activists engage climate change concerns in ways that may undermine public support. For example, activist groups like Extinction Rebellion (ER) see inattention to environmental damage in the Anthropocene as a critical concern. Other environmental movements have targeted industries--for example the coal industry, coal mining, and coal power plants. These actions are often only loosely coupled to climate outcomes: at first glance, for instance, there is only a passing connection between activities like blocking traffic in London and an outcome of slashing the carbon emissions before the year 2030. These activist groups seek to generate public attention by disrupting public events--an old tactic of activist groups [c.f. @Elsbach1992]--but their effects may be counterproductive.

Finally, these different understandings all exist against a backdrop of climate denial and the intentional sowing of skepticism. Many of the dynamics behind climate change are driven by another group of activist networks of actors: individuals and organizations intentionally sowing doubt about climate change knowledge. Research on these networks has been limited as scholars focus more on individual actors [@Farrell2016], but activist organizations such as the Cato Institute and the Heartland Institute, industry associations such as the American Petroleum Institute, and fossil fuel companies have all sought to shape our understandings of climate change [@Banerjee2015; @Bonneuil2021; @Supran2017; @Supran2020].

## Methodology

We will carry out our research in two stages. In the first stage, develop a model on the more general phenomenon: the emergence of policy in the Anthropocene. We use a mix of qualitative, and–where appropriate–quantitative methods to tease out both the technical and social dimension. At the end of this stage, we write up and submit study I. In the second stage, we develop insights on specific policy decisions. We first record the range of arenas in which policy discussions are fought out. We then use qualitative methods to compare and contrast actors’ strategies across the different arenas. We then write and submit study II.

### Context

We begin the first stage of our two-year project by compiling data on the fossil fuel industry in North America. We use oil pipelines to exemplify the broader context. Pipelines are of particular interest, because they are often built on public land and hence are the first to be affected by a changing political landscape. They are also critical bottlenecks to fossil fuel production and consumption, particularly in Canada. Hence we expect to find fertile ground here for studying the emergence of policy in the Anthropocene. We study the competing effects of a changing technical understanding and prevailing institutional interests. Based on an evolved technical understanding, projects such as Keystone XL, the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion have faced sharp public resistance, including from outspoken scholars [@Cheon2018]. Meanwhile, the pipeline industry wields its power in a regulatory arena which follows institutionalized rules that are decoupled from both science and national policy [@Palen2014].

### Stage 1

A model on the emergence of policy in the Anthropocene. We first review existing understandings of how institutional processes affect the efficiency of emergent policy [e.g., @Bromley2012; @Lyon2015; @Oliver1991]. We also review the literature on lobbying and the fossil fuel industry [e.g., @Farrell2016; @Mann2016; @Supran2020] as well as prior studies of the pipeline industry [e.g., @Chandler2020; @Park2019]. 
We will gather three forms of data on the policy decisions affecting the American pipeline network, focusing both on decisions to issue permits for new pipelines and on disputes over existing permits. Decisions and disputes about policy around oil pipelines are commonly affected by pipeline spills. We will therefore first use the Factiva database to identify the universe of emergent policy decisions and disputes in the United States and the associated discourse. We will then collect public data on those decisions via regulators’ websites through the docket that provides detailed data on the public responses to the decisions and disputes. Finally, we will use interviews with participants [cf. @Hardy2020]. 
We use a multi-step coding process to interpret our data, using the Atlas.ti software. In particular we identify through axial coding [@Strauss1990] documents in our database that relate to the competing technical and institutional imperatives that are of interest in–similar to the second stage of analysis in [@Maguire2013]. Where appropriate, we use quantitative data to supplement qualitative insights [cf. @Edmondson2007]. For that purpose, we also collect data on operators, pipeline miles, pipeline spills, and the amount of fossil fuels transported. In this study we observe the process of policy emergence in the Anthropocene, decoupled from technical knowledge and driven by institutional imperatives [@Bromley2012; @Latour2015]. In particular, the first study will fill a gap in the Anthropocene literature: we produce solid empirical evidence of how institutional interests and strategic interventions by the fossil fuel industry [cf. @Oliver1991] explain human impacts on the environment.

### Stage 2

In the first stage, we shine a spotlight onto one part of the puzzle. In the second stage, we reveal a more complete picture. For that purpose, we select a notable pipeline project, based on the data collected in the first stage. We map out the complete timeline of that pipeline project and identify moments in time where different groups grapple with and debate the environmental impacts of the pipeline project--the "Anthropocene moment." In turn, we tune into every arena [@Latour2004] where the pipeline project is discussed. We first construct an event-history database [@Strauss1990] based on press releases by news agencies to capture not only events where there is clear contestation–aka. news value–about environmental policy and outcomes. These press releases allow us to also capture uncontested events such as planning meetings which ultimately may have little news value, but potentially provide the actors’ remarks on issues of the Anthropocene such as climate change prior to a contentious public discourse.
We then "zoom in" [@Nicolini2009] to every arena and observe public discourse. We then construct the final dataset on the interactions in different arenas based on suitable sources such as government dockets with meeting minutes, press releases by pipeline operators and construction companies, and blogs as well as social media platforms where activists voice there concerns and plan their actions. We finally triangulate our data by interviewing key participants in the process. We then develop insights on how interaction between the actors in a public arena affects the emergence of policy. In the prior stage, we were particularly interested in pervasive institutional interests that work toward the realization of new pipeline projects. Now, we take a more comprehensive look at all participants’ parts in the process, how they arrive at their ends, and what means they use in discourse to get there [cf. @Maguire2009].
