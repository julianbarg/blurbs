## Summary of Proposal

### First paragraph--general phenomenon.

* Anthropocene
    - (Geological) Age of Men
        + Characterized by pollution, habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and climate change.
    - Issue causes general anxiety.
        + Which Gen Z in particular is now famous for.
    - A lot of research on the Anthropocene, especially from the sciences.
    - A renewed interest in the social in the sciences and organizing from outside the field.
        + "[N]o question of natural history has been better settled than the anthropic origin of climate change" [@Latour2015], so scientists are looking to social science [cf. @Heffernan2011].
    - The insight that more scientific discoveries will not help us if they are not implemented.
        + Example of researchers sounding the alarm on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) because they observe that findings on mitigation of climate change are watered down too much [@Harvey2021].
        + The group adopted the name Scientist Rebellion and includes Nobel Prize winner Jacques Dubochet. In 2021, the group leaked a draft section of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report climate change, due to be the year after. The draft states that "individual behavioral changes alone are insignificant" and raises concern about "governments [that are] pressured and bribed by fossil fuel and other industries" [@Vogt2021].
        * Probably don't want to put the full illustrative example here, but I wanted to provide context.
    - Let's analyze this phenomenon as an issue of organizing, from an organization theory perspective.

### Second paragraph--existing research and research questions.

* Existing research enters the phenomenon through a piecemeal approach.
    - Inaction/greenwashing:
        + Decoupling, symbolic management, impression management
        + This one is the most critical and underresearched in regard to climate change/the Anthropocene. Will receive special attention.
    - The generation of technical knowledge: 
        + Arena: science.
        + Incarnation: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.
    - The implementation of technical knowledge: politics/regulatory process.
        + Arena: politics and regulatory process.
        + Incarnation: Conference of the Parties (COP), also known as UN climate change conferences.
    - Social movements
    - Business sustainability
    - Climate denial
    - Various forms of manipulation, ranging from inaction and greenwashing to active resistance against institutional change?
* Research question
    - What is happening in the literature at the extreme end of the spectrum, on inaction, greenwashing and active resistance against institutional change?
        + How can we give this literature or these literatures a new direction?
    - How do interactions between opposed actors play out?
    - How does more generally environmental discourse play out?
    - How can we integrate these disparate phenoma in one framework?
* Strategy: Review extreme end, enter through general phenomenon, and return to the broader context.

### Third paragraph--research team, studies, and hiring.

* Content
