The phenomenon described above lends itself to sampling on extreme cases. Rather than establishing the prevalence of this phenomenon, I seek to prove its existence. For that purpose, I propose the following sampling strategy. As a fist step, I comb through news on the oil \& gas industry and look for scandals. Those scandals then are the basis for a further collection of data. A number of occurrences in the oil \& gas industry jump out to me as relevant. (1) Climate denialism and the long trail of documents which imply that companies like BP were familiar with the risks associated with climate change as early as half a century ago. (2) The Taylor Energy oil spill. (3) Possibly the application for pipeline construction permits. (4) Pipeline safety claims. (5)  Campaigns against renewable energy, such as in the aftermath of the 2021 Texas snow storm. (6) The pipeline industry's feigned ignorance regarding their downstream impacts. (7) Going a little bit beyond oil \& gas, the Koch Brothers' clean coal campaign.

The phenomenon also has implications beyond sustainability, and is relevant to OT more generally. Just use your imagination :)
