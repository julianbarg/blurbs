# M-J IDG Application 2021

## Summary of Proposal

Organized by paragraph.

### 1. General phenomenon.

* Anthropocene
    - (Geological) Age of Men
        + Characterized by pollution, habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and climate change.
    - Issue causes general anxiety.
        + Which Gen Z in particular is now famous for.
    - A lot of research on the Anthropocene, especially from the sciences.
    - A renewed interest in the social in the sciences and organizing from outside the field.
        + "[N]o question of natural history has been better settled than the anthropic origin of climate change" [@Latour2015], so scientists are looking to social science [cf. @Heffernan2011].
    - The insight that more scientific discoveries will not help us if they are not implemented.
        + Example of researchers sounding the alarm on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) because they observe that findings on mitigation of climate change are watered down too much [@Harvey2021].
        + The group adopted the name Scientist Rebellion and includes Nobel Prize winner Jacques Dubochet. In 2021, the group leaked a draft section of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report climate change, due to be the year after. The draft states that "individual behavioral changes alone are insignificant" and raises concern about "governments [that are] pressured and bribed by fossil fuel and other industries" [@Vogt2021].
        * Probably don't want to put the full illustrative example here, but I wanted to provide context.
    - Let's analyze this phenomenon as an issue of organizing, from an organization theory perspective.

### 2. Existing research and research questions.

* Existing research enters the phenomenon through a piecemeal approach.
    - Inaction/greenwashing:
        + Decoupling, symbolic management, impression management
        + This one is the most critical and underresearched in regard to climate change/the Anthropocene. Will receive special attention.
    - The generation of technical knowledge: 
        + Arena: science.
        + Incarnation: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.
    - The implementation of technical knowledge: politics/regulatory process.
        + Arena: politics and regulatory process.
        + Incarnation: Conference of the Parties (COP), also known as UN climate change conferences.
    - Social movements
    - Business sustainability
    - Climate denial
    - Various forms of manipulation, ranging from inaction and greenwashing to active resistance against institutional change?
* Research question
    - What are the common processes and interactions between the social and technical realms?
    - What is happening at the extreme end of the spectrum? 
        + Inaction, greenwashing and active resistance against institutional change.
        + How can we give this literature or these literatures a new direction?
    - How do interactions between opposed actors play out?
    - How does more generally environmental discourse play out?
    - How can we integrate these disparate phenoma in one framework?
* Strategy: Review extreme end, enter through general phenomenon, and return to the broader context.

### 3. Research team, studies, and hiring.

* Team
    - Labels in Wren's grant application invoke departments.
    - It would be great if this section could invoke interdisciplinarity, not sure if that can be done. Tom used the label 'economist' to accomplish this.
    - Mark Zbaracki
        + Management
        + Strategy
        + Rhetorics, power, politics
    - Julian Barg
        + Management
        + Sustainability
        + Environmental pollution, environmental discourse, fossil fuel industry, pipeline industry
    - Wren Montgomery
        + Management
        + Sustainability
        + Greenwashing, Organization Theory, Water Crises & Management, Environmental & Social Entrepreneurship
    - Maybe we can claim interdisciplinarity based on the literatures that we draw on.
        + **Lits here**
        + Or we should not put to much emphasis on this and just play up some of our other strenghts.
* Studies
    - Study I
        + Manipulation of public discourse: 
            * Symbolic management
            * Impression management
            * Decoupling
            * Greenwashing
        + Interdisciplinary literature review
        + Understand the extreme end
    - Study II
        + Keystone XL
        + Dakota Access Pipeline
        + Environmental discourse
        + Understand common interactions
        + Exemplify the different arenas of discourse in one high profile event of national/international significance
        + Archival and interview data to cover over 10 years of debate
    - Study III
        + Synthesis of literature and phenomenon
        + Mark, this is where we take your areas of interest and describe how we apply those to the Anthropocene
        + What would make this revolutionary/surprising? 
            * Probably the insight that both a lot that the Anthropocene literature has found on change management--for the lack of a better term, I really don't like this here--is not surprising from an OT perspective. 
            * And, to turn this theme on it's head, that parts of the OT literature becomes obsolete as we enter the Anthropocene.
* Hiring
    - We will hire two PhD students as research assistants to assist with studies 1 & 2 to assist and gain experience in all stages of our research.
        + I made this two, even though it may only be one. I am sure Wren has already secured funding for the greenwashing review. Maybe there is an option to gain some insight beyond that project on symbolic management/decoupling/impression management.
            
### 4. Goal/benefits

* Goal
    - Respond to the call for research on social-environmental dynamics that the sciences have put out.
    - Shed light on common processes and interactions between the social and technical realms.
    - Reduce the naivety for political dynamics--not as in regulatory but as in how decisions in the real world are made--in research on the Anthropocene.
* Benefits
    - Encourage more creative political intervention from climate science and other sciences.
    - Encourage more more vigilantism with regard to deliberate misinformation.
    - An appreciation for processes of knowledge creation and dissemination that takes place outside academia.
        + Is that somewhat contradicting the last point? If so we might just need to embrace that.

### 5. Impact/dissemination

* Conferences
* High-impact journals
* Industry/media/idk... what do you think is realistic? Would be nice to dream up something cool to do with that.

## Roles and responsibilities

* Team
    - Something good about the team, ideally about multidisciplinarity since that has become a bit of a buzzword. I cannot think of anything right now, maybe we just cover our different research interests (e.g., Wren--water).
    - Alternatively, maybe we could divide roles by areas covered by the inherently cross-disciplinary phenomenon (e.g., sciences, politics, business)?
        + Sure, that is conceived, but it would give us something to talk about.
    - Or alternatively, we could just write this section bland and boring to not draw too much attention to how non-interdisciplinary and relatively homogeneous (academically) this group is.
* Members
    - Wren covers in her section on members:
        + Role (e.g., Principal Investigator)
        + Research interest
        + Prior published works as part of the team
        + Recent (somewhat) relevant publication
        + Other relevant SSHRC-funded work
        + Work that highlights relevant methods (qualitative) and (somewhat relevant) research area (water)
        + Relevant work under review
        + Recognition through conference participation/invitation/whatever you want to call it
        + Recognition of work through other channels such as guest lectures
* Mark Zbaracki
    - Principal Investigator
    - Power and politics
    - Interdisciplinary work with economists on pricing
    - ToDo: Pick up relevant paper(s) and synthesize
        + Learning from rare events
        + Rhetorics and reality of tqm
    - 2004. Administrative Science Quarterly Award for Scholarly Contribution for “The Rhetoric and Reality of Total Quality Management.”
    - etc.
* Julian Barg
    - Co-applicant
    - Environmental pollution, environmental discourse, fossil fuel industry, pipeline industry
    - @Zbaracki2021
    - @Huang2017, @Huang2019
    - Chisholm Scholarship in Sustainability
    - 2018 AOM Annual Conference ONE Division Best Reviewer Award
    - 2021 AOM OMT Consortium
    - 2020 AOM ONE
    - Qualitative methods (CARMA with Michael G. Pratt)
    - Grant work with Wren?
* Wren Montgomery
    - Collaborator
    - Paraphrase from her grant application?
    - Principal Investigator Dr. Wren Montgomery’s research focuses on interactions between individual actors and macro-level institutional and field changes, especially around environmental sustainability. For example, in collaboration with senior scholar and Collaborator Thomas Lyon, Dr. Montgomery has explored these interactions in two prominent published papers on greenwashing. A recently published paper in Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal also explores the importance of cross-sectoral stakeholders in the development of North American carbon markets. In addition, together with her supervisor, Tina Dacin, Dr. Montgomery published a SSHRC funded paper in the Journal of Business Ethics that explored the role of micro-actors in social sustainability. Using qualitative case study methodology, Dr. Montgomery’s dissertation work examined the impact of water scarcity on business and field actors. In 2016, this dissertation research won two awards at the Academy of Management’s annual conference; the ONE (Organizations and the Natural Environment) Divisions’ best dissertation award, and an OMT (Organizations and Management Theory) Division best paper award. A further paper based on this dissertation data is currently in the second round of the revision process at Academy of Management Journal. Dr. Montgomery was invited to organize a conference-wide plenary session on water and business risk at the Academy of Management’s 2016 meeting. Her research has also been featured in several practitioner outlets including a case study on the Flint water crisis; guest lectures in University of Michigan MBA classes; University of Michigan and Queen’s University public lectures, blogs and white papers; consultations with Michigan water policy-makers; and, a League of Conservation Voters guest lecture.
* Team
    - Wren covers in her section on members:
        + Summary: Proficiency in methods, experience in similar projects
            * For now as a statement, evidence then follows
        + Prior similar projects
        + Prior (ongoing) SSHRC project
        + Prior similar qualitative work (Co-applicant)
        + Prior published work with collaborator (Tom)
    - We want to emphasize that we have worked in relevant areas before without giving away whether we are familiar with this context yet
    - Then we drop examples from the team members
    - Qualitative methods experience
        + This kind of study isn't new to us--maybe highlight Mark's interdisciplinary pricing research program as an example
    - Mark: describe prior research program which evolved into this one?
    - Julian    
        + CSR/green economy
        + Emphasize prior experience with fossil fuel/pipeline industry?
    - Wren
        + Greenwashing (and making sure not to use that word before?)
        + Qualitative work
* Responsibilities
    - Wren gave these in %, but we could use any language we like I suppose.
    - PI should have largest share and collaborator a minimal share, Wren's project for instance has a 55/40/5 split.
    - Starting point: study 3 is the one we place in Mark's realm. Study 2 should be in Julian/shared hands? Wren is involved in study 1. 
        + So maybe a 60/30/10 or 65/30/5? 
    - I am sure Wren already has a grant for her greenwashing work, so we can differentiate the work here by leaning into decoupling/symbolic management/impression management, which also brings it closer to Mark's existing work
    - Wren also gives an indication of time commitment, for instance on the PI: "Relative to other on-going projects, this workload will represent 50% of her research time." I have the impression that would not line up well with our responsibilities well, so maybe we should not go into too much detail--although the prompt might ask for this?
    - Here is some ideas of how we could characterize what we do to align with the terms PI, Co-applicant and Collaborators:
        + The PI is in charge of the overall project design and coordination as well as the hiring of two PhD students.
        + The PI will conduct study 3 with assistance from the 
        + The Co-applicant will under the guidance of the PI conduct and design study 2.
        + The Co-applicant and Collaborator will in coordination with the PI conduct study 1.
    - Wren also mentioned the supervision of hired PhD students here, not sure how to phrase that or whether we should gloss over this.
        
## Roles and Training of Students

* Not sure how to characterize this. Should this just mention the hiring of PhD students and gloss over details, or should this explicitly mention that the Co-applicant is the PhD student to be hired?
* After finishing the bullet points I noticed that I don't mention the Co-applicant once, which does not work out.
* Wren's Co-investigator is relatively clear on this:
    - "The Co-Investigator’s current graduate student from the Psychology Department (through which the CI supervises graduate students) will be hired as Student 2."
    - What are the rules around hiring?

* Hire and train two students as research assistants for two years.
    - Both students will be trained and carry out all stages of a scientific study, including knowledge mobilization.
        + Or in more detail: "Both students will be involved in (1) carrying out a literature review, (2) preparation of the study (e.g., ethics application, research protocols), (3) the collection and analysis of data, (4) the writing and submission of journal articles, (5) knowledge mobilization." But that is obsolete based on more detailed descriptions below.
    - Both students will be hired from the pool of PhD candidates at Ivey Business School.
    - * Wren's Co-investigator is clear on who she wants to hire:
        + "The Co-Investigator’s current graduate student from the Psychology Department (through which the CI supervises graduate students) will be hired as Student 2."
* Student 1 will be trained to and carry out a systematic literature review for the first study. The student will (1) systematically gather journal articles and develop selection criteria for a relevant literature, (2) conduct a bibliometric analysis, (3) synthesize the literature in a journal submission, (4) participate in the submission of an article,(5) present academic work at a conference or conferences, and (6) participate in knowledge mobilization.
    - (1) & (2) are based on the proposal I submitted with Wren & Tom.
* Student 2 will be trained and carry out a qualitative research project for the second study. The student will (1) carry out an archival data collection, (2) conduct an inductive analysis of the data using Atlas.ti, (3) triangulate the data through interviews, (4) transcribe the interviews, (5) prepare a journal submission based on the data, (6) participate in the submission of an article,(7) present academic work at a conference or conferences, and (8) participate in knowledge mobilization.
* Student one will work on study one of the project, and student two will work on study two. Both students will be hired for a period of two years, working 8 hours per week, over a period of 40 weeks in both year one and two, making for a total of 320 hour per year and student.
* Student 1 will be selected from the current PhD students at Ivey Business School that have some familiarity with the literature on the manipulation of public discourse, including symbolic management, impression management, decoupling, and greenwashing. The candidate should also have some proficiency in corpus selection and bibliometric analysis for a literature review. For training purposes, Student 1 will shadow the PI in his ongoing literature review work (referring to MWZ). The Collaborator will then give Student 1 guidance on bibliometric analysis based on her past publications [referring to @Lyon2015]. The student will receive some training on the use of VOSviewer, Citation Gecko, topic models, R Shiny for the presentation of results, as well as on the databases Web of Science, EBSCO, and ABI/Inform. The student will then participate in all phases of the first study.
    -  Based on the proposal I submitted with Wren. Yes, most of this stuff on the list I trained myself on, but that still counts as training...
*  Student 2 will be selected from the current PhD students at Ivey Business School based on her or his familiarity with qualitative research. The student will receive training on interviewing informants for data triangulation by the PI. This training will cover identifying and contacting potential informants, the preparation of interview protocols for data triangulation, transcription, and coding of the data in Atlas.ti. The student will then participate in all phases of the second study.
    -  Referring to the training I have already received from Mark.
*  Both students will participate in conferences and knowledge mobilization alongside the PI. First, both students will participate in the writing of short papers and their submission to conferences for the purpose of training. This training will allow the students to familiarize themselves with the academic review and revision process. Student 1 will co-present the findings of first study with the PI and/or the Collaborator in year one of the study, and Student 2 in year two. After this training they will prepare the final manuscript and submit the studies as articles to relevant journals. 
*  The PI will hold weekly meetings with students 1 and 2 for the duration of their respective study. The Collaborator will hold meetings as needed for about two months to train student 2. Both the PI and Collaborator will ensure to 
    -  Based on our meeting, and estimated based on the training Wren gave me.

## Knowledge Mobilization Plan

* Our goal is to share the generated insights with practitioners, the general public, and an academic audience. To that end, we share our findings in five channels.

### Academic conferences (within two years)

* We plan to present our work at relevant international conferences. In year one, we send a short paper to EGOS, and in year two to we submit to ARCS and EGOS.

### Journal articles (within three years)
    
* We plan to submit the completed studies to Administrative Science Quarterly, Journal Impact Factor (JIF) 11.113, to Organization Science, JIF 5.000, and to Organization & Environment, JIF 6.116. 
* We also plan to submit a Brief Communication to *Nature Climate Change*, JIF 25.290.
    - I added this second one after adding "Sciences" as an audience in the *Audiences* section.

### Teaching (within one year)

* Maybe we could put something here based on the session we did earlier this year? E.g.,:
    - We plan to include some of the findings and materials from the studies in the classroom. Specifically, we will include our framework and data in sessions with alumnus to discuss organizational and societal challenges associated with climate change and Covid.

### Practitioner outreach (within two years)

* To plan to share our research and insights with non-academic audiences, we make use of two special interest groups: the Network for Business Sustainability and the Center for Building Sustainable Value. After the completion of our study, we will also disseminate our findings to the environmental groups included in our study to benefit their future efforts.
* We could probably write more here. Here is what Wren wrote for reference:
    - Given that our research is aimed to encourage accurate disclosure as a means to enhance corporate environmental responsibility, we will share our findings with relevant non-academic audiences. We plan to do so by leveraging our existing partnerships with environmental groups/networks (e.g., Greening Organizations and Work Network; Network for Business Sustainability) and forming new relationships (e.g., Canadian Business for Social Responsibility) to arrange speaking opportunities. Through the PI and Collaborator’s extensive existing contacts in government (provincial, state and federal levels) and experience in whitepaper and report writing, we will also share our results with relevant government bodies (e.g., Industry Canada: Corporate Social Responsibility).

### Media (within two years)

* We plan to disseminate our research through our department's outlets, which regularly advertises research to a diverse audience. We also make syntheses and findings available through our personal blogs and social media accounts, as well as through specialized channels such as the Academy of Management's Organization and Natural Environment Group.
    - We could probable add more here. Are there any media outlets that we could contact once were in a more advanced stage?

## Scholarly Benefits

* Is this a drop-down menu? Here is what Wren put in for reference:
    1. Enhanced theory
    2. Student training/skill development
    3. Enhanced research collaboration
* We could probably make some grander claims than this based on our context.
* Regarding student training:
    - Wren's proposal is tailored so that she can argue that she is training four students. We would probably to well to replace this one.
* Maybe add something like this
    - Setting a research agenda
* We definitely do this:
    - Theory development
    - Integration of research from multiple disciplines
    
* So maybe this is our version:
    1. Setting a research agenda
    2. Integration of research from multiple disciplines
    3. Theory development
* Not fully satisfied with this, maybe you have some good ideas?

## Summary of Expected Scholarly Outcomes

* Could also add 1-3 sentences first to give a big picture.

1. Agenda setting
    * We will research a pressing issue of our time: dysfunctional environmental discourse. Environmental discourse is fragmented between different groups, and the interaction between these groups is primarily political (as opposed to discoursive). We will develop a research agenda on how this problem can be studied further.
2. Research integration
    * Our project is rooted in the sciences, organization theory, and sociology. We will develop a framework, the primary purpose of which is the integration of these diverging disciplines. In the process, we make research findings from the disciplines visible to each others audiences.
3. Theory development
    * The framework for research integration will be one part of a wider theory development effort. We will develop theory on corporations and other organization's inaction or greenwashing efforts, and on environmental discourse more broadly.
    
## Societal Benefits

* Is this drop-down? I will just assume its not.
* Wren lists her research as benefiting policy, practitioners, and environmental outcomes. I think we have different things in mind that we seek to address. What I am trying to convey is that we speak to how knowledge flows from the bottom right to the top right (third point), to the problems associated with the bottom right (first point), and a something about environmental groups in the top left because that's a popular topic that looks good on a grant proposal. There is so much more we could speak to though, including to practitioners via business sustainability.

1. Problematize the manipulation of public discourse
2. Enhance strategies for environmental discourse
3. Enhance strategies for science communication

## Summary of Expected Societal Outcomes

Our research will shed light on some of the key characteristics around public discourse and knowledge dissemination in the Anthropocene. Practitioners, including environmental NGOs, scientists, and observers such as the media or governments will benefit from the integrative model that we will develop. We will condense our model into specific advice for individual groups with specific strategic goals in an environmental discourse such as the one on Keystone XL.

We do not aim to develop a "better mode of discourse" or any of the likes, since our preliminary research suggests that what climate scientists, policy makers, and other actors encounter in the Anthropocene is 

1. Problematize the manipulation of public discourse
    * The pipeline industry provides a great case study for some of the more far-reaching manipulation efforts that social science is starting to take note of. We will move the manipulation of public discourse into the context of knowledge and discourse on the Anthropocene, and develop an accessible model to help the public understand the relevant dynamics.
2. Enhanced strategies for science communication
    * We will generate insight on the flow of knowledge from the scientific community into police making processes and to the general public. Based on our insights, we will provide suggestions on how to create knowledge on the Anthropocene with concerns about knowledge dissemination and public discourse already baked in.
3. Enhanced strategies for environmental discourse
    * Similarly, we will advice participants in environmental discourse on how to break out of the mold to achieve their goals. To that end, we will share the findings with environmental groups that are part of our second study.

## Audiences

1. Academic peers
2. Sciences
3. Environmental NGOs
4. The public & practitioners

We differentiate between adjacent and external academic audiences, as well as between participants and non-participants of the processes we are interested in. The knowledge generated in this research benefits these audiences in different ways.

1. We will develop theory that is immediately useful to our academic peers in organization theory and business sustainability. This theory will be developed directly with these audiences in mind.
2. In addition to developing new theory for use in our own field, we also use the data and themes from our studies to speak to an academic audience conducting scientific research on the Anthropocene and technology. To that end, we will submit a Brief Communication to *Nature Climate Change* that presents a synthesis of our findings and methods.
3. The findings from our studies--especially our synthesis and analysis of the Keystone XL discourse in study two--will be immediately useful to environmental NGOs in understanding how environmental goals can be accomplished from an underdog position.
4. Our findings on knowledge dissemination and implementation and the role of non-state actors will be useful for the public more widely. To that end, we will promote especially studies one and two in our communication with practitioners through our networks.

## Funds Requested from SSHRC

* For now, I only have the personnel costs in here. But it might be a good idea to put in some other costs like Wren did. I believe that would be expected of an IDG application, and a proposal that just asks for the cost of hiring PhD students would stand out.
* Some of the costs that Wren put in there:
    - Transcription
    - Field work/interview trips, team & students
    - Conference & workshop costs, again team & students
    - Supplies, covering software
    - Expenses for survey design
    - Participant compensation

### Year 1

#### Personnel

* Doctoral 
* 1
* We hire 2 PhD students as research assistants to work on studies one and two. Both students will be involved in (1) carrying out a literature review, (2) preparation of the study (e.g., ethics application, research protocols), (3) the collection and analysis of data, (4) the writing and submission of journal articles, (5) knowledge mobilization. In year one of the study, both students will be working 8 hours per week, over a period of 40 weeks, for a total of 320 hour per student. Both students will be paid $28 per hour or $8,960 per year (8 x 40 x $28) including benefits, per department guidelines. The total cost will be $17,920 ($8,960 x 2).
