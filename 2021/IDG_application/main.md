# M-J IDG Application 2021

## Summary of Proposal

Organized by paragraph.

### 1. General phenomenon.

* Anthropocene
    - (Geological) Age of Men
        + Characterized by pollution, habitat destruction, loss of biodiversity, and climate change.
    - Issue causes general anxiety.
        + Which Gen Z in particular is now famous for.
    - A lot of research on the Anthropocene, especially from the sciences.
    - A renewed interest in the social in the sciences and organizing from outside the field.
        + "[N]o question of natural history has been better settled than the anthropic origin of climate change" [@Latour2015], so scientists are looking to social science [cf. @Heffernan2011].
    - The insight that more scientific discoveries will not help us if they are not implemented.
        + Example of researchers sounding the alarm on Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) because they observe that findings on mitigation of climate change are watered down too much [@Harvey2021].
        + The group adopted the name Scientist Rebellion and includes Nobel Prize winner Jacques Dubochet. In 2021, the group leaked a draft section of the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report climate change, due to be the year after. The draft states that "individual behavioral changes alone are insignificant" and raises concern about "governments [that are] pressured and bribed by fossil fuel and other industries" [@Vogt2021].
        * Probably don't want to put the full illustrative example here, but I wanted to provide context.
    - Let's analyze this phenomenon as an issue of organizing, from an organization theory perspective.

### 2. Existing research and research questions.

* Existing research enters the phenomenon through a piecemeal approach.
    - Inaction/greenwashing:
        + Decoupling, symbolic management, impression management
        + This one is the most critical and underresearched in regard to climate change/the Anthropocene. Will receive special attention.
    - The generation of technical knowledge: 
        + Arena: science.
        + Incarnation: Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports.
    - The implementation of technical knowledge: politics/regulatory process.
        + Arena: politics and regulatory process.
        + Incarnation: Conference of the Parties (COP), also known as UN climate change conferences.
    - Social movements
    - Business sustainability
    - Climate denial
    - Various forms of manipulation, ranging from inaction and greenwashing to active resistance against institutional change?
* Research question
    - What are the common processes and interactions between the social and technical realms?
    - What is happening at the extreme end of the spectrum? 
        + Inaction, greenwashing and active resistance against institutional change.
        + How can we give this literature or these literatures a new direction?
    - How do interactions between opposed actors play out?
    - How does more generally environmental discourse play out?
    - How can we integrate these disparate phenoma in one framework?
* Strategy: Review extreme end, enter through general phenomenon, and return to the broader context.

### 3. Research team, studies, and hiring.

* Team
    - Labels in Wren's grant application invoke departments.
    - It would be great if this section could invoke interdisciplinarity, not sure if that can be done. Tom used the label 'economist' to accomplish this.
    - Mark Zbaracki
        + Management
        + Strategy
        + Rhetorics, power, politics
    - Julian Barg
        + Management
        + Sustainability
        + Environmental pollution, environmental discourse, fossil fuel industry, pipeline industry
    - Wren Montgomery
        + Management
        + Sustainability
        + Greenwashing, Organization Theory, Water Crises & Management, Environmental & Social Entrepreneurship
    - Maybe we can claim interdisciplinarity based on the literatures that we draw on.
        + **Lits here**
        + Or we should not put to much emphasis on this and just play up some of our other strenghts.
* Studies
    - Study I
        + greenwashing, symbolic management, impression management, decoupling, manipulation
        + Interdisciplinary literature review
        + Understand the extreme end
    - Study II
        + Keystone XL
        + Dakota Access Pipeline
        + Environmental discourse
        + Understand common interactions
        + Exemplify the different arenas of discourse in one high profile event of national/international significance
        + Archival and interview data to cover over 10 years of debate
    - Study III
        + Synthesis of literature and phenomenon
        + Mark, this is where we take your areas of interest and describe how we apply those to the Anthropocene
        + What would make this revolutionary/surprising? 
            * Probably the insight that both a lot that the Anthropocene literature has found on change management--for the lack of a better term, I really don't like this here--is not surprising from an OT perspective. 
            * And, to turn this theme on it's head, that parts of the OT literature becomes obsolete as we enter the Anthropocene.
* Hiring
    - We will hire two PhD students as research assistants to assist with studies 1 & 2 to assist and gain experience in all stages of our research.
        + I made this two, even though it may only be one. I am sure Wren has already secured funding for the greenwashing review. Maybe there is an option to gain some insight beyond that project on symbolic management/decoupling/impression management.
            
## 4. Goal/benefits

* Goal
    - Respond to the call for research on social-environmental dynamics that the sciences have put out.
    - Shed light on common processes and interactions between the social and technical realms.
    - Reduce the naivety for political dynamics--not as in regulatory but as in how decisions in the real world are made--in research on the Anthropocene.
* Benefits
    - Encourage more creative political intervention from climate science and other sciences.
    - Encourage more more vigilantism with regard to deliberate misinformation.
    - An appreciation for processes of knowledge creation and dissemination that takes place outside academia.
        + Is that somewhat contradicting the last point? If so we might just need to embrace that.

## 5. Impact/dissemination

* Conferences
* High-impact journals
* Industry/media/idk... what do you think is realistic? Would be nice to dream up something cool to do with that.

## 6. Roles and responsibilities

* Team
    - Something good about the team, ideally about multidisciplinarity since that has become a bit of a buzzword. I cannot think of anything right now, maybe we just cover our different research interests (e.g., Wren--water).
    - Alternatively, maybe we could divide roles by areas covered by the inherently cross-disciplinary phenomenon (e.g., sciences, politics, business)?
        + Sure, that is conceived, but it would give us something to talk about.
    - Or alternatively, we could just write this section bland and boring to not draw too much attention to how non-interdisciplinary and relatively homogeneous (academically) this group is.
* Members
    - Wren covers in her section on members:
        + Role (e.g., Principal Investigator)
        + Research interest
        + Prior published works as part of the team
        + Recent (somewhat) relevant publication
        + Other relevant SSHRC-funded work
        + Work that highlights relevant methods (qualitative) and (somewhat relevant) research area (water)
        + Relevant work under review
        + Recognition through conference participation/invitation/whatever you want to call it
        + Recognition of work through other channels such as guest lectures
* Mark Zbaracki
    - Principal Investigator
    - Power and politics
    - Interdisciplinary work with economists on pricing
    - ToDo: Pick up relevant paper(s) and synthesize
        + Learning from rare events
        + Rhetorics and reality of tqm
    - 2004. Administrative Science Quarterly Award for Scholarly Contribution for “The Rhetoric and Reality of Total Quality Management.”
    - etc.
* Julian Barg
    - Co-applicant
    - Environmental pollution, environmental discourse, fossil fuel industry, pipeline industry
    - @Zbaracki2021
    - @Huang2017, @Huang2019
    - Chisholm Scholarship in Sustainability
    - 2018 AOM Annual Conference ONE Division Best Reviewer Award
    - 2021 AOM OMT Consortium
    - 2020 AOM ONE
    - Qualitative methods (CARMA with Michael G. Pratt)
    - Grant work with Wren?
* Wren Montgomery
    - Collaborator
    - Paraphrase from her grant application?
    - Principal Investigator Dr. Wren Montgomery’s research focuses on interactions between individual actors and macro-level institutional and field changes, especially around environmental sustainability. Forexample, in collaboration with senior scholar and Collaborator Thomas Lyon, Dr. Montgomery has explored these interactions in two prominent published papers on greenwashing. A recently published paper in Strategic Entrepreneurship Journal also explores the importance of cross-sectoral stakeholders in the development of North American carbon markets. In addition, together with her supervisor, Tina Dacin, Dr. Montgomery published a SSHRC funded paper in the Journal of Business Ethics that explored the role of micro-actors in social sustainability. Using qualitative case study methodology, Dr. Montgomery’s dissertation work examined the impact of water scarcity on business and field actors. In 2016, this dissertation research won two awards at the Academy of Management’s annual conference; the ONE (Organizations and the Natural Environment) Divisions’ best dissertation award, and an OMT (Organizations and Management Theory) Division best paper award. A further paper based on this dissertation data is currently in the second round of the revision process at Academy of Management Journal. Dr. Montgomery was invited to organize a conference-wide plenary session on water and business risk at the Academy of Management’s 2016 meeting. Her research has also been featured in several practitioner outlets including a case study on the Flint water crisis; guest lectures in University of Michigan MBA classes; University of Michigan and Queen’s University public lectures, blogs and white papers; consultations with Michigan water policy-makers; and, a League of Conservation Voters guest lecture.
* Team
    - Wren covers in her section on members:
        + Summary: Proficiency in methods, experience in similar projects
            * For now as a statement, evidence then follows
        + Prior similar projects
        + Prior (ongoing) SSHRC project
        + Prior similar qualitative work (Co-applicant)
        + Prior published work with collaborator (Tom)
    - We want to emphasize that we have worked in relevant areas before without giving away whether we are familiar with this context yet
    - Then we drop examples from the team members
    - Qualitative methods experience
        + This kind of study isn't new to us--maybe highlight Mark's interdisciplinary pricing research program as an example
    - Mark: describe prior research program which evolved into this one?
    - Julian    
        + CSR/green economy
        + Emphasize prior experience with fossil fuel/pipeline industry?
    - Wren
        + Greenwashing (and making sure not to use that word before?)
        + Qualitative work
* Responsibilities
    - Wren gave these in %, but we could use any language we like I suppose
    - PI should have largest share and collaborator a minimal share, Wren's project for instance has a 55/40/5 split
    - Starting point: study 3 is the one we place in Mark's realm. Study 2 should be in Julian/shared hands? Wren is involved in study 1. 
        + So maybe a 60/30/10 or 65/30/5? 
    - I am sure Wren already has a grant for her greenwashing work, so we can differentiate the work here by leaning into decoupling/symbolic management/impression management, which also brings it closer to Mark's existing work
    - Wren also gives an indication of time commitment, for instance on the PI: "Relative to other on-going projects, this workload will represent 50% of her research time." I have the impression that would not line up well with our responsibilities well, so maybe we should not go into too much detail--although the prompt might ask for this?
    - Here is some ideas of how we could characterize what we do to align with the terms PI, Co-applicant and Collaborators:
        + The PI is in charge of the overall project design and coordination as well as the hiring of two PhD students.
        + The PI will conduct study 3 with assistance from the 
        + The Co-applicant will under the guidance of the PI conduct and design study 2.
        + The Co-applicant and Collaborator will in coordination with the PI conduct study 1.
    - Wren also mentioned the supervision of hired PhD students here, not sure how to phrase that or whether we should gloss over this.
        
## 7. Roles and Training of Students

* Not sure how to characterize this. Should this just mention the hiring of PhD students and gloss over details, or should this explicitly mention that the Co-applicant is the PhD student to be hired?
