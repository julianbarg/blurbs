  abstract = {A general and systematic account of the role of knowledge in society aimed to stimulate both critical discussion and empirical investigations.This book is concerned with the sociology of ‘everything that passes for knowledge in society’. It focuses particularly on that ‘common-sense knowledge’ which constitutes the reality of everyday life for the ordinary member of society.The authors are concerned to present an analysis of knowledge in everyday life in the context of a theory of society as a dialectical process between objective and subjective reality. Their development of a theory of institutions, legitimations and socializations has implications beyond the discipline of sociology, and their ‘humanistic’ approach has considerable relevance for other social scientists, historians, philosophers and anthropologists.},

  abstract = {This paper traces the eventful legacy of The Social Construction of Reality, by Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, which has been widely acclaimed as a classic text in sociology, but also has been subject to glaring and persistent misinterpretations. The paper discusses the inception and significance of the title along with the principal arguments of the authors’ work. The main achievements and shortfalls of the intellectual project behind the book are considered. The paper also introduces the contents of a special issue of Cultural Sociology to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the book’s publication.},
