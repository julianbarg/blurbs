% Alternative title: Deinstutionalization or standoff?

% \noindent Or maybe: Institutional standoff

% \subsection*{Approach}

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Pick up \citet{Maguire2009}
% 		\subitem - Discuss deinstitutionalization?
% 		\subitem - Or take learning angle?
% 	\item Pick up epistemic communities \citep{Aronczyk2019}
% 		\subitem a. Pipeline operators
% 		\subitem b. Activists
% 		\subitem c. Nature
% 		\subitem d. Third party: experts, politicians and the public
% 		\subitem - Emphasize the prevalence of situations where multiple epistemic communities interact
% 		\subitem - Is a discussion of epistemic communities a contribution by itself?
% 	\item Decisions are not made through discourse but in the political realm at the highest level
% 		\subitem Obama blocking vs. Trump rubberstamping Keystone XL
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{Contribution}

% There are two potential contributions that this section can make. The first one is to simply just respond to \citep{Maguire2009}. The second approach is to create an alternative model, using the language of learning and epistemic communities. What 

% % \subsubsection*{Approach}
% \subsection*{Approach}

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Pick up \citet{Maguire2009}
% 	\item Show all actors and their interrelationships
% 		\subitem a. Pipeline operators
% 		\subitem b. Activists
% 		\subitem c. Nature
% 		\subitem d. Third party: experts, politicians and the public
% 	\item Show their interests and interaction
% 	\item Temporality--show the sequence of deadlock and creation of facts--pipelines--that has lead to the status quo
% 		\subitem What we would conventionally call progress
% 		\subitem A mode of decision making
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{Data points--events}

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Kalamazoo River pipeline spill
% 		\subitem Post spill safety spending on 
% 	\item Dakota Access Pipeline protests
% 	\item Keystone XL application process
% 		\subitem You cannot have a debate when decisions are just made by another administration
% 		\subitem There is just one direction based on this process--more pipelines
% 		\subitem Astroturfers use the completion of hearings as evidence of the rationality of the project
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{Contribution}

% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Show all actors involved \& their interests
% 		\subitem Frames and frame changes (or lack thereof)
% 		\subitem What prevents frame changes
% 	\item Show all the characters involved to get at the complexity
% 	\item Introducing more characters and their action
% 	\item Their agenda, perspective \& oversights
