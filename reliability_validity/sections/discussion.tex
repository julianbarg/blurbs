\subsection*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Some observations of (political) processes that complicate processes of reliable and valid learning. Below some examples.
	\item \citet{Pailler2018}:
		\subitem Acting against better knowledge when (individual) political interests involved
	\item \citet{Aronczyk2019}:
		\subitem Interest groups insert themselves into learning processes early on, with complex implications for knowledge creation
		\subitem In this case, the interest groups has engaged in valid learning on stakeholders (MNCs) and their interests
			\subsubitem Or reliable learning, because their prediction on industry action did not pan out? Very political process at hand.
		\subitem Lessens primacy of validity with regard to \textit{physical} processes--the \textit{social} sphere gets to be considered
	\item \citet{Boudet2020}:
		\subitem "Resilience" of reliable over valid learning. Reliable learning can persevere in the face of overwhelming evidence that \textit{should} constitute cosmology episode
