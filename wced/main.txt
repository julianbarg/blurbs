Ecocentrism vs. Environmental Management
Julian Barg
February 18, 2021
What is sustainable? What is sustainability? There are some formulaic
definitions that are widely accepted, including the dogmatic definition that
”[s]ustainable development is development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs”
(WCED, 1987, p. IV). But if you ask two sustainability scholars to define sustainability in their own terms, chances are you are still going to get very different
answers. Potentially including the ubiquitous phrase ”I know it when I see it”
(White, 2013). All that is not to criticize sustainability scholarship. It is the
nature of the beast of dealing with complex systems–such as our planet–that
things are difficult to nail down.
Definitions attain importance in research because they shape the research
that takes place after the introduction section. Things may be assumed away,
and a definition can determine the direction of a research project. The definition
of sustainable development by the WCED–despite being the most widely used
definition of sustainability by far–is still contested. On the one hand, the WCED
definition is widely used as a working definition. On the other hand, the WCED
definition is criticized for putting too much focus on economic development
for resolving current and future distributive and environmental problems (e.g.,
Constanza et al., 2014, 6f.).
This blurb introduces the discourse on the WCED definition and what assumptions it introduces to research. It covers on the one hand research in
business journals that apply the definition. These articles have in common that
they turn to businesses and their policy decisions for potential solutions to common environmental or social problems. On the other hand, there is a critical
discourse on sustainable development that explicitly discusses the inherent assumptions and typically rejects the notions that companies are suitable agents
that can be relied on for change (e.g., Banerjee, 2003).
The discourse is driven by competing assumptions on the ability for corporations to act as agentic actors for change.
• Add ”third way” implications similar to Giddens (1979).
• Actually in some sense, this directly parallels Gidden’s comments on structure vs. agency–e.g., Heikkurinen et al. (2019).

Avoid label
”critical” for
its connotations?

Terminology and Definition
A range of terms have emerged to describe the different takes on sustainability. For the critical stream, there is ”ecocentrism” (Purser et al., 1995), ”deep
ecology” (Newton, 2002), the New Ecological Paradigm (Catton and Dunlap,
1980 via Hoffman and Jennings, 2015) or even ”ecofascism” (Newton, 2002).
For the mainstream take there are ”environmental management” (Purser et al.,
1995), ”corporate sustainability” (Ergene et al., 2020), and ”eco-modernism”
(Springett, 2003). Note that in these citations, the labels represent attribution
by the critical camp. Mainstream work also picks up terms such as ”corporate sustainability”, albeit ”uncritical”–not as labels to describe themselves or
differentiate a mainstream take from the critical take.
An authors use of the WCED definition of sustainability is more useful as a
benchmark, as it represents a deliberate choice by the author that differentiates
the two camps. The mainstream work on sustainability routinely uses the definition and adopt the related language while the critical camp may pick it up to
discuss its merits and shortcomings.

Environmental Management
First, we will look at some well-cited works that pick up and build on the WCED
definition of sustainability. Bansal (2005) includes the definition in an empirical
research paper.

Conclusion
Above, I inadvertently ”accused” business sustainability to arrive at corporations agency as a ”solution” because that is our turf and what we talk about.
Here, I have to disclose for the sake of fairness, that I am biased toward taking
the middle ground, both because it follows the findings of (Giddens, 1979) and–I
assume–I am biased toward it because it is the most comfortable position for
me to take. So if we seek to depart from a ”structure vs agency”-type debate,
what route should we take? It is obvious that corporations agency is not the
solution to pressing problems such as climate change. At the same time, one can
acknowledge partial solutions that corporations have (partly) delivered, such as
renewable energy, electric vehicles, and the internet which helps coordination.
That doesn’t mean that an eventual ”solution” needs to be within the confines
of the current ”system”. Solutions offered by corporations can be picked up by
other actors. Or other actors can step in to force corporations to do more under
the guise of ”mutually accepted coercion” (Heilbroner 1974)
That seems like now I am leaning toward the critical way, so here it is more
clearly: based on the fact that structures have momentum any future ”solution”

to climate change–if it comes about at all–will likely be neither entirely based
on the agency of corporations, nor will it happen without the involvement of
corporations. So the debate is ”nice to have” but it is unfortunately detached
from reality.
