\title{Ecocentrism vs. Environmental Management}
\author{Julian Barg}
\begin{document}

	\maketitle

	% AMR has nothing on sustainability. Maybe because it is commonly assumed that there is no theorie to sustainability, only norms. This paper talks to that claim and shows that indeed, sustainability struggles when it is pressed to produce theories, or even just a definition. Some abstract discussion on sustainability might be necessary to set the direction. Research on sustainability is not unscientific--even if outlets such as AMR might be the wrong ones to discuss the phenomena that matter to sustainability.

	% Sustainability should be in the mainstream. There is more people here to contribute insights. Echo-chamerism is dangerous.

	\subsubsection*{Discussion}

	% Academic work should not become obsolet through the passage of time--for excellent work, the opposite is often true. Is it time for a clear break with old material?

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Agentic view of corporations in environmental management
			\subitem Unsurprising for business school faculty to turn to organizations/corporations as a potential solution--is that problematic?
		\item Structuralist view in ecocentrism
		\item Suggest encompassing view--agentic organizations responding to external pressure
			\subitem Renewable energy: external impetus, for-profit companies as agents of implementation.
		\item Difficulty of "proving" a world view vs. another
			\subitem \citet{Giddens1979}
	\end{itemize}

	\subsection*{Conclusion}

	\begin{itemize}	
		\item Suggest turn toward debates focused on specific, local contexts and phenomena
			\subitem Problem of organizational inertia--future solutions will have to come about in the context of a economic and societal structure that is similar to or derived from the current one--study it!
		\item Present examples from extant literature--\url{http://wiki.jbarg.net/Extant%20empirical%20paper}.

	% Above, I inadvertently "accused" business sustainability to arrive at corporations agency as a "solution" because that is our turf and what we talk about. Here, I have to disclose for the sake of fairness, that I am biased toward taking the middle ground, both because it follows the findings of \citep{Giddens1979} and--I assume--I am biased toward it because it is the most comfortable position for me to take. So if we seek to depart from a "structure vs agency"-type debate, what route should we take? It is obvious that corporations agency is not the solution to pressing problems such as climate change. At the same time, one can acknowledge partial solutions that corporations have (partly) delivered, such as renewable energy, electric vehicles, and the internet which helps coordination. That doesn't mean that an eventual "solution" needs to be within the confines of the current "system". Solutions offered by corporations can be picked up by other actors. Or other actors can step in to force corporations to do more under the guise of "mutually accepted coercion" (Heilbroner 1974)
	% \todo{Not the exact wording I think.}

	% That seems like now I am leaning toward the critical way, so here it is more clearly: based on the fact that structures have momentum 
	% \todo{Forgot the right word here but NVM.}
	% any future "solution" to climate change--if it comes about at all--will likely be neither entirely based on the agency of corporations, nor will it happen without the involvement of corporations. So the debate is "nice to have" but it is unfortunately detached from reality.

	% We have to accept social realities--or if we don't we have to be willing to really fight.
