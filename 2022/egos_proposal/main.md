We have entered the Anthropocene. We are no longer simply passive observers of the natural world [@Lewis2015]. Instead, we live in a human-dominated geological epoch in which we can no longer maintain a separation between Human and Nature [@Latour2015]. In the face of droughts in California [@AghaKouchak2015], the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event [@Hughes2019; @Conroy2019], and dwindling insect bio mass [@Hallmann2017; @Seibold2019], the consequences of the Anthropocene have become hard to ignore [@Sterner2019]. Having recognized that the problem is more than technical, [@Heffernan2011; @Ripple2017], scientists have turned to diverse forms of activism [@Thompson2021; @Ripple2017; @Vogt2021; @Malm2020], seeking to use their scientific and technical knowledge to develop policy that will hold firms accountable for their practices.

Stepping outside the academic arena, scientists face a dilemma. On the one hand business sustainability has gone mainstream [@Lyon2018]. Around the world, governments have put targets in place, rallying around the 1.5ยบ Paris agreement goal. But so far, these changes in rhetoric have not resulted in a change of trajectory. Pledges for action repeatedly lag ambitions for limiting global warming [@Rogelj2016; @Schleussner2016], real emissions show no sign of slowing [@Tollefson2021], and the rainforest is still disappearing [@Gatti2021; @Hoang2021]. Firms subvert these goals or set the wrong goals to begin with. Starting from the existing literatures, we see three pathways to exploring the phenomenon. First, we could analyze the lack of climate action as a simple issue of policy-practice decoupling [@Bromley2012]--then the next step would be to look for instances of symbolic management, and analyze how fossil fuel companies can be held to their word. Or, we could focus on the battle over the right means and ends [@Bromley2012], for instance by retracing whether instruments such as carbon markets actually lead to emissions reductions or not [@Bansal2013]. Finally, we can analyze the political arenas in which specific actions are being fought over. @Barley2010 suggests that in these arenas there is an infrastructure in place that actively undermines the translation of policy into research, and this infrastructure is what we should attend to.

<!-- * What has been lacking is research on the constitutive character of a firm's action for our social reality. -->

<!-- * Finally, there is an infrastructure in place to actively undermine ... @Barley2010

1. Treat as compliance issue (symbolic mngt)
2. Focus on it as a battle of the right means and ends
3. Think of it as a political conflict as opposed to a battle over scientific truth -->

<!-- The literature on institutional theory has treated this lack of substantive action on climate goals as an simply a compliance issue. Firms bow to the pressure and introduce policies that they never translate into practice. And when policy is translated into practice, many firms may unintentionally choose the wrong means for their green ends [@Wijen2014; @Bromley2012]. Where outcomes fall short of goals, firms have been shown to engage in symbolic responses such as greenwashing: producing communication that misleads people about the extent of their environmental practices or products [@Lyon2015]. --> 

We explore the constitutive aspect of firm's action for social reality through an inductive case study of two major fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the United States. The case study highlights how environmental pledges using the language of business sustainability conceal real goals, including the goal to subvert sound environmental policy. We find efforts by the fossil fuel industry to suppress adversaries and undermine their goals. These anti-activist activities subdue activism and undermine environmentalists' efforts to raise public awareness. These activities by fossil fuel companies can only stand because of the industry's more longstanding efforts to undermine climate science and shape public perception: through these activities, the industry has amassed a sizable support network [@Supran2017; @Mann2016; @Dochuk2019]. Our empirical findings suggest that to understand the social deconstruction of reality, we need to tune into the institutional structure of corporate lobbying--an area of research that unfortunately largely lies dormant [@Barley2010].

## Data and Methods

We study two major fossil fuel infrastructure projects. Public hearings and planning meetings for Keystone XL (KXL) began in 2009. In 2015, the President rejected the permit application, before the incoming President in 2017 invited TransCanada (now TC Energy) to resubmit their application. Construction began, but the permit was revoked by the new administration in 2021. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) was first announced in 2014 and began transporting oil in 2014. Both pipelines were subject to considerable public debate, and a focal point of the 2016 Presidential election. KXL further attracted much attention for its potential climate impacts [@Erickson2014], whereas the "Battle at Standing Rock" over the DAPL [@Erickson2014] can be taken as a yardstick for the polarized increasingly violent political climate in the US. The debate around the pipelines gives gives us an opportunity to observe how organizations can foster alternative views on seemingly settled issues--in other words, we examine populism and post-truth under the microscope.

### Data

From the Factiva database, we extracted all news articles on the two pipelines published by the three major news agencies: Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse. We have opted to rely on agency news, rather than on for instance newspapers of records, to ensure a good coverage of relevant events such as meetings and hearings. Specifically, we were concerned that newspapers articles would only cover events in which the pipelines are actively challenged--in other words, newsworthy events. Agency news also feature announcements of upcoming events that are published before the newsworthiness is established. Hence, our dataset allows us to observe also the taken-for-grantedness of pipelines in non-newsworthy events [@Steele2021]. In addition, we iteratively collected additional data on the positions and strategies of all involved parties, e.g., filed testimonies, interviews, and blog posts. In some cases, internal documents were either leaked or published following requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)--for example emails of the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign that shed line on the team's position on KXL, law enforcement emails regarding the DAPL protest camps, and internal TransCanada documents regarding a TransCanada engineer that blew the whistle on his employer.

### Analysis

Our research takes a grounded theory approach. We began our analysis by noting all events in which two or more actors come together to discuss one of the pipeline projects in an even-history database. We are specifically looking for congregations that constitute what @Latour2005 calls "arenas" where in principle actors discuss a specific object of concern--a pipeline. These arenas constitute the basis of our analysis. 

We then entered into the arenas and coded them for the nature of the interaction, such as legislative, consultative, or free speech situations. We noted that there were situations that appeared to be or began as one kind of arena, but then devolved into another. For instance, the public consultation process in principle institutes unrestrained forums where residents can inquire on any subject relating to a construction project. 

* Some were classic political influence stories
* Others were more ambiguous
* We found that the policy movements did not directly correlate to either of these dynamics
<!-- In practice however, a corporate lawyer has many means to restrain the scope of these forums, and they become events in which the corporation can demonstrate their dominance over the sphere of the project. We adjusted our coding system accordingly to capture this additional dimension of power and submission in some forums. -->

Next, we zoomed in on specific moment in times that precede surprising changes in stance of one or more actors--moments where a new social reality is in its infancy. For example, on Nov 2015, TransCanada asks the State Department to suspend its permit application for KXL, a move that a White House speaker calls "unusual" [@Chiacu2015]. We then enter into each of these moments in turn and code the actions of fossil fuel companies or those with connection to the industry that affect this social reality in its infancy. Through this coding step, we were able to compile a number of mechanisms through which fossil fuel companies affect policy, practice, and public perception.

## Findings

Our findings reveals the dynamics of the complex institutional structure that has been built around efforts to shape the pipeline approval process. We identify two different ways that this institutional structure has been created. One approach focuses on shaping policy, with different practices depending on the political orientation of the actors. A second focuses on shaping materiality--the potential and actual site of the fossil fuel infrastructure. These two different approaches seek both to assemble coalitions of diverse actors in support of policies and to divide different actors. Both approaches sometimes involve unexpected actors and proceed in some surprising ways, as we now show. 

<!-- Throughout the data, we see various actors at work to create an amiable environment for the fossil fuel infrastructure projects, including law and lobbying firms, trade associations, and think tanks. We were able observe in the empirical data how these actors in practice shape public perception--that is, how they engage or attempt the destruction of a social reality which is disadvantageous for them.

* which social reality?
* creating multiple alternative social realities which are advantageous to them
* set up introduction to talk about materiality vs policy--direct influence on policy, more indirect influence on policy

Beyond providing empirical evidence in support of @Barley2010, we also address an oversight in his article, and in the institutional literature more broadly. Our additional findings relate to the materiality of what is being discussed--oil pipelines--and what that entails. Communities that live along the route of a proposed pipeline have means of blocking these infrastructure projects. We demonstrate the importance of materiality by drawing on the role of previously overlooked groups such as landowners, police forces, and private security companies.

* The political dynamics draw attention from climate change but create coalitions -->

### Wrangling policy and policy makers

The behavior of the fossil fuel companies varies dramatically depending on their policy target. The KXL debate hinges on allies, adversaries, and coalition building rather than on the merit. With supportive politicians the tactics focused on building a coalition of advocates. One very visible instance of these tactics was demonstrated by TransCanada in its repeated collaboration with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a non-profit organization comprised of conservative state legislators and private organizations assembled to draft and influence state legislative policy. In 2012, TransCanada partnered with ALEC to deliver the "ALEC Oil Sands Academy." An ethics complaint filed against Nebraska state senator revealed the details of the event: nine state lawmakers were flown from various states in the U.S.--including Nebraska--to Alberta in Canada for a three-day event with TransCanada and other representatives of the Canadian oil industry. 

The event was supported by a range of other actions. Also in 2012, ALEC published a "Resolution in Support of the Keystone XL Pipeline" that served as a model bill. The resolution was introduced in twelve state legislatures and passed by six. In 2013 and 2014, TransCanada co-sponsored the ALEC Annual Conference that brought lawmakers together Jeb Bush and other similar keynote speakers; lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry; and members of the Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank known for its climate change denial. Details of these private events came to light after investigative journalists begin targeting ALEC (De Souza, 2014), but the political network of TransCanada is generally not secretive. It was also effective in garnering political support for the Keystone XL project. In 2015, for example, the US Senate passed Keystone XL Approval Act to bypass the regular permit approval process.

* Parallel structure--how is direct influence constructed here
* In this case, they are bringing together policy makers and presenting model bills
* Strip this down, figure out what you want the reader to see

In contrast, the release of Hillary Clintonโs campaign emails revealed lobbying that sought to break apart coalitions. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, as the only undecided candidate on Keystone XL, received pressure from both environmental groups and from trade unions to take a stance on KXL. For example, the League of Conservation Voters (LCV) explicitly stated in emails to the campaign chairman John Podesta that their endorsement was contingent on an anti-KXL stance. Conversely Labor Outreach Director for the Clinton campaign warned after a meeting with trade union representatives that an anti-KXL stance would alienate important unions like LIUNA. These trade unions were not acting alone, however: instead, the fossil fuel industry used **>>the right word?<<** support from the trade unions to signal grassroot support. The email trail from April through September 2015 showed how the Clinton campaign reconciled the competing demands through a plan that included both an anti-KXL stance *and* pipeline modernization measures to increase jobs. Notably, the policy plan never addressed the issues of climate change and environmental risk.

* In this case, they are no model bills or people getting together. It is just a demand.
* They are using allies of environmentalists. Complex relationships. It's the lack of unity

### Bending materiality

But the politics of approval clearly did not hinge on climate change alone. Indeed, much of the resistance to KXL crystallized around the issue of landownership. Both DAPL and KXL are megaprojects. DAPL is 1,886 km long and crosses four states. KXL would be slightly longer at 1,897km. As negotiations with landowners for rights-of-way to construct the pipelines stalled in 2014, TransCanada used the threat of eminent domain in letters to holdouts. Recipients of these letters became the backbone of KXL resistance. These lawsuits were costly for landowners, who described their lives as "on hold" as the drawn-out lawsuits proceeded. But they shifted the venue of the policy debate to the court of law--and slowed the approval process dramatically. For example, the landownersโ lawsuit against Nebraska law LB1161 held up KXL for over two years. By September 2015 when TransCanada exited the lawsuit that it had fought side by side with the state of Nebraska against landowners, momentum had turned against the pipeline as it was facing new challenges on the federal level.

Direct influence strategies an appropriate tool for those seeking to shape new or changing existing legislation at its source. Another kind of political activism emerges from the physical location of the proposed projects. Though this class of activism is far removed from questions of climate policy--climate change is picked up as a theme because of goal alignment, but it is not the trigger--the activism influences policy in critical ways.

Both DAPL and KXL are megaprojects. DAPL is 1,886 km long and crosses four states. KXL would be slightly longer at 1,897km. The resistance against KXL first crystallized around the issue of landownership. The toolbox of fossil fuel companies includes the use of eminent domain to acquire rights of way for the construction of pipelines. As negotiations with some landowners stall in 2014, TransCanada uses the threat of eminent domain as a psychological weapon in letters to holdouts. Some of the recipients of these letters later form the backbone of the resistance against KXL, for instance in a lawsuit of landowners against Nebraska law LB1161 which sees KXL stalled in court for over two years. The lawsuits come at a high cost for landowners, who describe their lives as "on hold" as the drawn out lawsuits proceed.

More so than landowners who are reluctant to give up the rights to lands that families have held for generations, the construction of the pipelines leads to conflicts with indigenous groups who see themselves as stewards of the land. In South Dakota, one such conflict emerges between ETP and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. The activists are part of the water protector movement, which focuses on the protection of the water sources used by indigenous communities. Here, the fossil fuel company does not use direct influence strategies to drive policy, but acts much more indirectly to meet its strategic goals. Some 3,000-4,000 activists at standing rock managed to stall the construction of DAPL for ten months, from April 2016 to February 2017. These activists engage in direct action, such as blocking service roads for excavators or locking themselves to construction equipment. At the time, the pipeline operator held the necessary construction permit, although as of 2022 the permit for the pipeline is contested in court and a new environmental review is under way.

In this arena, the fossil fuel company finds that it can accomplish its goals effectively without directly engaging the activists on the issue. ETP hires private security company TigerSwan to handle security on the site of the protest. TigerSwan employs mostly Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans. Using drone footage and covert surveillance, TigerSwan creates daily intelligence reports which it then also shares with the police. These reports are later obtained by investigative journalists using FOIA requests, providing us with a unique inside perspective. The reports use a military language to describe the protesters, at the height of confrontation describing the protest camp as following a "jihadist insurgency model" [@Porter2017].

Eventually, the protesters and the private security firms clash as ETP moves forward with the construction. The private security company and police forces employs a number of strategies that prove very successful in intimidating individual protesters and deterring them from further activism. Protesters are spayed with water from water cannons in freezing temperatures. TigerSwan employs guard dogs, leaving at least six with bites. The water protector movement attracts particularly female tribe members as it is traditionally a gendered role--multiple of them later describe traumatizing arrests and strip searches. Gender repeatedly shows up as a theme in conjunction with violence and trauma: "You know what it's like to watch a little girl get pushed down and shot point blank in the face while we're trying to save her?" [Prairie McLaughlin, female activist, cited in @Levin2016].

The resistance against DAPL on the local level could not prevent the construction of the pipeline, but for ten months, it was the protesters were the only ones preventing ETP from completing it. Since DAPL does not cross national borders, it is not subject to federal policy, and it had the support of the four relevant state legislatures. Only on the local level did ETP face opposition, which TigerSwan and police forces successfully crushed.

## Discussion

We observe empirically how fossil fuel companies engage in the erosion of social reality, by building political networks and propagating favorable frames through these. These extended networks can also directly undermine the positions of adversaries as shown in the Hillary Clinton campaign. More indirectly, fossil fuel companies have means to attain their goals at a regional scale that we have not yet paid attention to. Both constructions and activism are geographically bound, which opens another arena that scientists need to attend to. The ability to influence national policy does not constitute a guarantee that emissions and pollution can be tackled.

* Time, action and activism are geographically bound.

Overall, our research draws a challenging picture for scientists that want to engage in activism, and for those of us who are interested in researching a post-truth world. To make inroads on the social destruction of reality, it is not sufficient to enter into debates and provide the better argument--so far so unsurprising. Instead, we need to attend to the politics of how social reality is negotiated, as best exemplified by the Clinton campaign case study. Even with the better argument, one still needs to enter into the arena, and build a coalition in order to get the word out. Where this amounts to activism, one would do well to attend to objects of concern, such as the pipelines in our study, and enter here to make a tangible difference. Allies can be found, although one needs to attend to the divergence in interest of e.g., climate scientists and local activists. Pushback is to be expected in either arena, though taking a different form depending on whether we directly or indirectly seek to influence policy. 

* Building coalition
* Divide and conquer
* Shifting frames
* Shifting tactics/misrepresentation
