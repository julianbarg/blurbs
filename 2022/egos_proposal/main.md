We have entered the Anthropocene. We are no longer simply passive observers of the natural world [@Lewis2015]. Instead, we live in a human-dominated geological epoch in which we can no longer maintain a separation between Human and Nature [@Latour2015]. In the face of droughts in California [@AghaKouchak2015], the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event [@Hughes2019; @Conroy2019], and dwindling insect bio mass [@Hallmann2017; @Seibold2019], the consequences of the Anthropocene have become hard to ignore [@Sterner2019]. Having recognized that the problem is more than technical, [@Heffernan2011; @Ripple2017], scientists have turned to diverse forms of activism [@Thompson2021; @Ripple2017; @Vogt2021; @Malm2020], seeking to use their scientific and technical knowledge to develop policy that will hold firms accountable for their practices.

Stepping outside the academic arena, scientists face a precarious situation. On the one hand, business sustainability has gone mainstream, and green has become the next big buzzword. Around the world, governments have put targets in place, rallying around the 1.5ยบ Paris agreement goal. But so far, these changes in rhetoric have translated into very little tangible changes. Pledges for action repeatedly lag ambitions for limiting global warming [@Rogelj2016; @Schleussner2016], real emissions show no sign of slowing [@Tollefson2021], even the calls to save the rain forest have gone unheard [@Gatti2021; @Hoang2021]. Firms have found many ways to subvert the goals. A growing firm can improve carbon efficiency and still end up with a higher carbon footprint. Paper straws are better than plastic straws, but still a straw man. Finally, instruments such as carbon market may be contributing ambiguity more than they contribute emission reductions [@Bansal2013].

The literature on institutional theory has treated this lack of substantive action on climate goals as an simply a compliance issue. Firms bow to the pressure and introduce policies that they never translate into practice. And when policy is translated into practice, many firms may unintentionally choose the wrong means for their green ends [@Wijen2014; @Bromley2012]. Where outcomes fall short of goals, firms have been shown to engage in symbolic responses such as greenwashing: producing communication that misleads people about the extent of their environmental practices or products [@Lyon2015]. What has been lacking is research on the constitutive character of a firm's action for our social reality.

We explore this constitutive aspect of firm's action for social reality through an inductive case study of two major fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the United States. The case study highlights how environmental pledges using the language of business sustainability conceal real goals, including the goal to subvert sound environmental policy. We find efforts by the fossil fuel industry to suppress adversaries and undermine their goals. These anti-activist activities subdue activism and undermine environmentalists' efforts to raise public awareness. These activities by fossil fuel companies can only stand because of the industry's more longstanding efforts to undermine climate science and shape public perception: through these activities, the industry has amassed a sizable support network [@Supran2017; @Mann2016; @Dochuk2019]. Our empirical findings suggest that to understand the social deconstruction of reality, we need to tune into the institutional structure of corporate lobbying--an area of research that unfortunately largely lies dormant [@Barley2010].

## Data and Methods

We study two major fossil fuel infrastructure projects. Public hearings and planning meetings for Keystone XL (KXL) began in 2009. In 2015, the President rejected the permit application, before the incoming President in 2017 invited TransCanada (now TC Energy) to resubmit their application. Construction began, but the permit was revoked by the new administration in 2021. The Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) was first announced in 2014 and began transporting oil in 2014. Both pipelines were subject to considerable public debate, and a focal point of the 2016 Presidential election. KXL further attracted much attention for its potential climate impacts [@Erickson2014], whereas the "Battle at Standing Rock" over the DAPL [@Erickson2014] can be taken as a yardstick for the polarized increasingly violent political climate in the US. The debate around the pipelines gives gives us an opportunity to observe how organizations can foster alternative views on seemingly settled issues--in other words, we examine populism and post-truth under the microscope.

### Data

From the Factiva database, we extracted all agency news from AFP, AP, and Reuters on the two pipelines. We have opted to rely on agency news, rather than on for instance newspapers of records, to ensure a good coverage of relevant events such as meetings and hearings. Specifically, we were concerned that newspapers articles would only cover events in which the pipelines are actively challenged--in other words, newsworthy events. Agency news also feature announcements of upcoming events that are published before the newsworthiness is established. Hence, our dataset allows us to observe also the taken-for-grantedness of pipelines in non-newsworthy events [@Steele2021]. In addition, we iteratively collected additional data on the positions and strategies of all involved parties, e.g., filed testimonies, interviews, and blog posts. In some cases, internal documents were either leaked or published following requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Noteworthy examples include emails of the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign that shed line on the team's position on KXL, law enforcement emails regarding the DAPL protest camps, and internal TransCanada documents regarding a TransCanada engineer that blew the whistle on his employer.

### Analysis

Our research takes a grounded theory approach. We began our analysis by noting all events in which two or more actors come together to discuss one of the pipeline projects in an even-history database. We are specifically looking for congregations that constitute what @Latour2005 calls "arenas" where in principle actors discuss a specific object of concern--a pipeline. These arenas constitute the basis of our analysis. 

We then entered into the arenas and coded them for the nature of the interaction, such as legislative, consultative, or free speech situations, using an open coding system. We noted that there were situations that appeared to be or began as one kind of arena, but then devolved into another. For instance, the public consultation process in principle institutes unrestrained forums where residents can inquire on any subject relating to a construction project. In practice however, a corporate lawyer has many means to restrain the scope of these forums, and they become events in which the corporation can demonstrate their dominance over the sphere of the project. We adjusted our coding system accordingly to capture this additional dimension of power and submission in some forums.

Next, we zoomed in on specific moment in times that precede surprising changes in stance of one or more actors--moments where a new social reality is in its infancy. For example, on Nov 2015, TransCanada asks the State Department to suspend its permit application for KXL, a move that a White House speaker calls "unusual" [@Chiacu2015]. We then enter into each of these moments in turn and code the actions of fossil fuel companies or those with connection to the industry that affect this social reality in its infancy. Through this axial coding step, we were able to compile a number of mechanisms through which fossil fuel companies affect policy, practice, and public perception.

## Findings

Our findings align well with the characterizations in @Barley2010. Throughout the data, we see various actors at work to create an amiable environment for the fossil fuel infrastructure projects, including law and lobbying firms, trade associations, and think tanks. We were able observe in the empirical data how these actors in practice shape public perception--that is, how they engage or attempt the destruction of a social reality which is disadvantageous for them. 

Beyond providing empirical evidence in support of @Barley2010, we also address an oversight in his article, and in the institutional literature more broadly. Our additional findings relate to the materiality of what is being discussed--oil pipelines--and what that entails. Communities that live along the route of a proposed pipeline have means of blocking these infrastructure projects. At the same time, activism and advocacy is geographically bound, and can be disrupted. We demonstrate the importance of materiality by drawing on the role of previously overlooked groups such as landowners, police forces, and private security companies.

### Strategy A: Wrangling policy

To give their infrastructure projects the best chance to thrive, both TransCanada and the company behind DAPL engage in many of the political efforts described in @Barley2010. The work of industry and trade associations as well as think tanks is particularly salient. Through these networks, fossil fuel companies can reach policy makers, administrators as well as the general public. 

The most visible instance of these standard influencing tactics is TransCanada's repeated collaboration with the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative think tank. In a direct collaboration, the two partners organize the 2012 "ALEC Oil Sands Academy"--ALEC Academies typically run a sponsor $80,000--for which nine state lawmakers are flown into Alberta for three days and met with TransCanada and other representatives of the Canadian oil industry. ALEC in 2012 also publishes a Resolution in Support of the Keystone XL Pipeline as a model bill which has been introduced in twelve state legislatures and passed by six. In 2013 and 2014, TransCanada co-sponsors the ALEC Annual Conference. The Annual Conference brings together lawmakers like keynote speaker Jeb Bush and lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry, among others, but also features prominent climate denial shops like the Heartland Institute. Although details of these events are not public and only come to light after investigative journalists begin targeting ALEC [@DeSouza2014], the political network of TransCanada in general is not a secret one. TransCanada has attained widespread mainstream political support for the KXL project--in 2015, the US Senate by a margin of 62 to 36 passes the Keystone XL Approval Act to bypass the regular permit approval process.

In the months following the Presidents veto of the Keystone XL Approval Act, KXL becomes a major issue for the 2016 presidential election. The release of Hillary Clinton's campaign emails provides a rare inside perspective of what it is like to be at the receiving end of political influence tactics. Hillary Clinton, as the only undecided candidate on the issue, is lobbied by both environmental groups and trade organizations to take a stance on KXL. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) explicitly states in emails to the campaign chairman John Podesta that their endorsement would be contingent on an anti-KXL stance. The campaign's Labor Outreach Director on the other hand warns after a meeting with trade union representatives that an anti-KXL stance would alienate important unions like LIUNA. These trade unions generally have good ties to the fossil fuel industry, and are a means for the fossil fuel industry to signal grassroot support. The campaign spends the months from April through September 2015 trying to reconcile the two stances before finally committing to a climate plan that includes an anti-KXL stance as well as job creation measures such as pipeline modernization. At no time however does the campaign engage in a debate on the specific risks for climate and the environment stemming from the pipeline. In the political debate, KXL remains an issue of allies, adversaries, and coalition building rather than merit--the stance on the project is an issue of allegiance.

### Strategy B: Bending materiality

Both DAPL and KXL are megaprojects. DAPL is 1,886 km long and crosses four states. KXL would be slightly longer at 1,897km. The resistance against KXL first crystallized around the issue of landownership. The toolbox of fossil fuel companies includes the use of eminent domain to acquire rights of way for the construction of pipelines. As negotiations with some landowners stall in 2014, TransCanada uses the threat of eminent domain as a psychological weapon in letters to holdouts. Some of the recipients of these letters later form the backbone of the resistance against KXL, for instance in a lawsuit of landowners against Nebraska law LB1161 which sees KXL stalled in court for over two years. The lawsuits come at a high cost for landowners, who describe their lives as "oh hold" as the drawn out lawsuits proceed.

More so than landowners who are reluctant to give up the rights to lands that families have held for generations, the construction of the pipelines lead to conflicts with indigenous groups who see themselves as stewards of the land. In South Dakota, one such conflict emerges between the company behind DAPL and the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.
