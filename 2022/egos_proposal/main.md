We have entered the Anthropocene. We are no longer simply passive observers of the natural world [@Lewis2015]. Instead, we live in a human-dominated geological epoch in which we can no longer maintain a separation between Human and Nature [@Latour2015]. In the face of droughts in California [@AghaKouchak2015], the Great Barrier Reef bleaching event [@Hughes2019], and dwindling insect bio mass [@Hallmann2017], the consequences of the Anthropocene have become hard to ignore [@Sterner2019]. Having recognized that the problem is more than technical, [@Heffernan2011; @Ripple2017], scientists have turned to diverse forms of activism [@Thompson2021; @Ripple2017; @Vogt2021], seeking to use their scientific and technical knowledge to develop policy that will hold firms accountable for their practices.

In moving from a scholarly to a political arena, scientists face a dilemma. On the one hand business sustainability has gone mainstream [@Lyon2018], and governments have put targets in place to meet the 1.5º Paris agreement goal. On the other hand, these targets have not altered the trajectory of climate change. Pledges for action repeatedly lag ambitions for limiting global warming [@Rogelj2016], real emissions show no sign of slowing [@Tollefson2021], and the rainforest is still disappearing [@Gatti2021]. Firms frequently either subvert these goals or even set the wrong goals. And corporations have built a sizable network of opposition [@Dochuk2019; @Mann2016; @Supran2017].

The existing literature takes two approaches to this lack of climate action. One is to treat it as a simple problem of policy-practice decoupling [@Bromley2012], focused on how firms use symbolic management like greenwashing [@Lyon2015] to sidestep policy. A second is to focus on means-ends decoupling [@Bromley2012], for instance by retracing whether carbon markets actually lead to emissions reductions [@Bansal2013]. Left unexplored is how corporations build an infrastructure to shape policy either directly. As @Barley2010 observes, organizational and institutional research has largely ignored how this infrastructure has been built over the past fifty years.

<!-- * What has been lacking is research on the constitutive character of a firm's action for our social reality. -->

<!-- * Finally, there is an infrastructure in place to actively undermine ... @Barley2010

1. Treat as compliance issue (symbolic mngt)
2. Focus on it as a battle of the right means and ends
3. Think of it as a political conflict as opposed to a battle over scientific truth -->

<!-- The literature on institutional theory has treated this lack of substantive action on climate goals as an simply a compliance issue. Firms bow to the pressure and introduce policies that they never translate into practice. And when policy is translated into practice, many firms may unintentionally choose the wrong means for their green ends [@Wijen2014; @Bromley2012]. Where outcomes fall short of goals, firms have been shown to engage in symbolic responses such as greenwashing: producing communication that misleads people about the extent of their environmental practices or products [@Lyon2015]. --> 

We explore the constitutive aspect of firm’s action on social reality through an inductive case study of two major fossil fuel infrastructure projects in the United States. The case study highlights how environmental pledges using the language of business sustainability conceal efforts by the fossil fuel industry to shape policy, suppress adversaries, and undermine environmental activism to raise public awareness. Our empirical findings suggest that to understand the social deconstruction of reality, we need to uncover how these longstanding efforts to undermine climate science and shape public perception flow from the institutional structure of corporate lobbying [c.f. @Barley2010].

## Data and Methods

We study the debate over two major fossil fuel infrastructure projects. One is Keystone XL (KXL), for which planning began in 2009 and construction began after the presidential transition and 2017, but was halted after the permit was revoked by the new administration in 2021. The second is Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), which began transporting oil in 2014. Both pipelines were subject to considerable public debate, and a focal point of the 2016 Presidential election. KXL further attracted more attention for its potential climate impacts [@Erickson2014], but the "Battle at Standing Rock" over the DAPL [@Read2016] is a yardstick for the polarized increasingly violent political climate in the US. The debate around these two pipelines reveals the dynamics of populism and post-truth proceed on seemingly settled issues.

### Data

From the Factiva database, we extracted all news articles on the two pipelines published by the three major news agencies: Associated Press, Reuters, and Agence France-Presse. We chose agency news rather than newspapers because they offer a broader range of relevant events. Where newspapers articles might choose dramatic events where pipelines are actively challenged--for example, demonstrations--news agencies reports will include less newsworthy, but relevant meetings and hearings. Our dataset therefore includes taken-for-grantedness of non-newsworthy events [@Steele2021]. We then followed those events and collected data on the positions and strategies of all involved parties, through filed testimonies, interviews, blog posts, leaked internal documents (for example emails of the Hillary Clinton 2016 presidential campaign), items published under the Freedom of Information Act (for example, law enforcement emails regarding the DAPL protest camps), and documents about a TransCanada whistleblower.

### Analysis

We began our analysis by noting all events in which two or more actors come together to discuss one of the pipeline projects in an even-history database. We looked for what @Latour2005 calls “arenas” where actors discuss a specific object of concern–a pipeline. We then categorized action in the arenas according to the nature of the interaction, such as legislative, consultative, or free speech situations. We noted that there were situations that appeared to be or began as one kind of arena, but then devolved into another. For examples, concerns over potential pipeline spills fomented the resistance against KXL in Nebraska, but questions were not heard in the public consultation process pipeline safety is a federal concern and the pipeline had to be assumed to be safe. 

Next, we zoomed in on specific moment in times that precede surprising changes in stance of one or more actors–moments where a new social reality is in its infancy. For example, on Nov 2015, TransCanada asked the State Department to suspend its permit application for KXL, a move that a White House speaker called "unusual" [@Chiacu2015]. We then coded the actions of fossil fuel companies to compile actions by which they affected policy, practice, and public perception. Some actions were classical political influence stories. Others actions were more ambiguous: they did not directly affect other actors and their stances, but had an effect toward the overall goal. Fossil fuel companies seek to shape the policy arena, but they also need to build pipelines. Activists were most successful in confronting pipelines when the tethered their actions to local issues and local political support.    

<!-- Some of the moments that we found were classical political influence stories. Others actions were more ambiguous: they did not directly affect other actors and their stances, but had an effect toward the overall goal. These second kinds of actions correspond with the materiality of the infrastructure project. Fossil fuel companies need to attain their goals in the policy arena, but they also need succeed in building the pipeline on the ground. Successful activism does not directly correspond to either successful political endeavors or activism. Where activism was both tethered to local issues and had some political support, the fossil fuel companies were slowed down in their progress. -->

## Findings

Our findings reveal a robust institutional structure built around efforts to shape the pipeline approval process. This institutional structure has been used to shape policy, to shape the materiality of the proposed pipelines, and even to shape the material conduct of the protests. In support of the infrastructure, fossil-fuel companies and their allies have assembled new coalitions of diverse actors to support policies and have sought to divide different other existing coalitions. Their efforts sometimes involve unexpected actors and proceed in some surprising ways, as we now show.

<!-- Throughout the data, we see various actors at work to create an amiable environment for the fossil fuel infrastructure projects, including law and lobbying firms, trade associations, and think tanks. We were able observe in the empirical data how these actors in practice shape public perception--that is, how they engage or attempt the destruction of a social reality which is disadvantageous for them.

* which social reality?
* creating multiple alternative social realities which are advantageous to them
* set up introduction to talk about materiality vs policy--direct influence on policy, more indirect influence on policy

Beyond providing empirical evidence in support of @Barley2010, we also address an oversight in his article, and in the institutional literature more broadly. Our additional findings relate to the materiality of what is being discussed--oil pipelines--and what that entails. Communities that live along the route of a proposed pipeline have means of blocking these infrastructure projects. We demonstrate the importance of materiality by drawing on the role of previously overlooked groups such as landowners, police forces, and private security companies.

### Wrangling policy and policy makers

The behavior of the fossil fuel companies varies dramatically depending on their policy target. In the KXL debate, political tactics focused on building a coalition of supportive politicians and advocates. One very visible example was a repeated collaboration between TransCanada and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a non-profit organization comprised of conservative state legislators and private organizations assembled to draft and influence state legislative policy. In 2012, TransCanada and ALEC delivered an “ALEC Oil Sands Academy.” An ethics complaint filed against Nebraska state senator revealed the details of the event: nine state lawmakers were flown to Alberta from various states in the U.S.–including Nebraska—for a three-day event with TransCanada and other representatives of the Canadian oil industry.

The event was part of a portfolio of actions. Also in 2012, ALEC published a "Resolution in Support of the Keystone XL Pipeline" that served as a model bill. The resolution was introduced in twelve state legislatures and passed by six. In 2013 and 2014, TransCanada co-sponsored the ALEC Annual Conference that brought lawmakers together Jeb Bush and other similar keynote speakers; lobbyists from the fossil fuel industry; and members of the Heartland Institute, a conservative and libertarian think tank known for its climate change denial. Details of these private events came to light after investigative journalists begin targeting ALEC [@DeSouza2014], but the political network of TransCanada is generally not secretive. It was also effective in garnering political support for the Keystone XL project. In 2015, for example, the US Senate passed Keystone XL Approval Act to bypass the regular permit approval process.

* In this case, they are bringing together policy makers and presenting model bills
* Strip this down, figure out what you want the reader to see -->

In contrast, the release of Hillary Clinton’s campaign emails revealed how political networks can break apart coalitions, with significant ripple effects. In 2012, the Laborers' Union of North America (LIUNA) left the BlueGreen Alliance--a network of major environmental and labor organizations--over the organization's opposition to KXL. In the 2016 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton, as the only undecided candidate on Keystone XL, received pressure from both environmental groups and from trade unions to take a stance on KXL. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) explicitly stated in emails to the campaign chairman John Podesta that their endorsement was contingent on an anti-KXL stance. Conversely Labor Outreach Director for the Clinton campaign warned after a meeting with trade union representatives that an anti-KXL stance would alienate important unions like LIUNA. The email trail from April through September 2015 showed how the Clinton campaign reconciled the competing demands through a plan that included both an anti-KXL stance *and* pipeline modernization measures to increase jobs. Notably, the policy plan never addressed the issues of climate change and environmental risk.

### Bending materiality

But the politics of approval hinged on more than climate change alone. Much of the resistance to KXL crystallized around the issue of landownership. Both DAPL and KXL are megaprojects. DAPL is 1,886 km long and crosses four states. KXL would be slightly longer at 1,897km. As negotiations with landowners for rights-of-way to construct the pipelines stalled in 2014, TransCanada used the threat of eminent domain in letters to holdouts. Recipients of these letters became the backbone of KXL resistance. They filed lawsuits that they said put their lives “on hold,” but they also shifted the policy debate to the court of law–and slowed the approval process dramatically. For example, the landowners’ lawsuit against Nebraska law LB1161 held up KXL for over two years. By September 2015 when TransCanada exited the lawsuit that it had fought with the state of Nebraska against landowners, momentum had turned against the pipeline.

Another form of political activism emerges from the physical location of the proposed projects. The construction of the pipelines also led to conflicts with indigenous groups who see themselves as stewards of the land. In South Dakota, one such conflict emerged with the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and activists in the water protector movement focused on protecting the water sources used by indigenous communities. Here the fossil-fuel company response was much less direct. More than 3000 activists slowed the DAPL construction for ten months by blocking service roads for excavators or locking themselves to construction equipment. 

In response, the pipeline company hired TigerSwan, a private security company that employs mostly Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans. Using drone footage and covert surveillance, TigerSwan created daily intelligence reports that it shared with the police—and that investigative journalists obtained using FOIA requests. Using military language, the reports describe the protesters as following a "jihadist insurgency model" [@Porter2017]. To deter protesters, the private security company and police forces sprayed protesters with water from water cannons in freezing temperatures. TigerSwan used guard dogs, leaving at least six with bites. Female tribe members in the indigenous water protector movement described a number of traumatizing arrests and strip searches. And gender repeatedly appears in conjunction with violence and trauma: "You know what it's like to watch a little girl get pushed down and shot point blank in the face while we're trying to save her?" [Prairie McLaughlin, female activist, cited in @Levin2016].

Though the local resistance failed to prevent the construction of the pipeline, for ten months the protesters were the only active resistance. DAPL does not cross national borders, it is not subject to federal policy, and it had the support of the four relevant state legislatures. TigerSwan and police forces successfully crushed the resistance.

## Discussion

We show how fossil fuel companies erode social reality, by building political networks, by propagating favorable frames, and by undermining adversaries through direct and indirect opposition. Both constructions and activism are geographically bound, so much of this action occurs regionally, not nationally. Scientists seeking to influence policy in a post-truth world will need to attend to the politics of social reality as much as the politics of scientific reality. The tactics are time tested—coalition building, divide and conquer, shifting frames, and misrepresentation of reality. Allies can be found, though the interests may diverge—climate scientists and local activists, for example. Pushback is to be expected in either the national or the local arena. But the fight is not always fair, and it does not proceed on knowledge alone.
