## Introduction

* Empirical grounding paragraph
    - Intersection of two themes
        + Fossil fuel industry/climate change
        + Post truth
    - Connection between the two themes
        + Important role of fossil fuel industry in American politics [@Dochuk2019]
        + The central role of fossil fuel companies--such as the Koch brothers--in American lobbying networks [@Barley2010; @Farrell2016]<!-- 
        + Overlap between conspiracy theories
            * Climate hoax, covid, QAnon
            * This one we will just have to hope that they buy it without citation as support -->
        + Demonstrated by Trump KXL day one decision
* Findings
    - Specific findings
        + Fossil fuel companies specifically seek to influence policy
            * In response to, and ahead of infrastructure projects
        + Fossil fuel companies adopt the strategies of their adversaries in rallying the public
        + Other actors have to specifically challenge these strategies within the context/network to counter, there is no blanket approach
            * Long breath necessary--PR work and other responses. It's an old tale for the industry
            * Or is there a blanket approach? Counter example tobacco industry
        + Sometimes, the strategic actor is its own worst enemy though (unintended consequences)
    - General theory
        - The important role of politics in actors taking a position
            * Taking positions to improve relations with relevant actors
            * Taking positions to influence processes
            * Taking positions to counteract adversaries
* Literature--this is something that was overlooked
    - Constitutive role of lobbying in politics (at times)
    - Two different ways to anchor in literature
        + A look at the overall workings: Decoupling
        + A look at firm action: dsi, greenwashing
* Research context
    - Oil infrastructure
    - Deliminated: Project based
        + Keystone XL
        + And Dakota Access Pipeline?
    - Repeated case study of the same project
    
## Data & Methods

* Context & relevance
    - Importance of KXL in 2016 & 2020 elections
    - Importance for climate change
    - A yardstick for the political climate
* Data
    - All public and quasi-public meetings on Keystone XL (and DAPL?) 2009-2021
    - Obtained from agency news to avoid bias
    - Sampled events:
        + Moments where there were undecided participants
        + Avoid shining lights at actors/moments where a position was an issue of identity already and thereby clear
        + How does power play out to influence an actors perception of what is true?
* Analysis
    - Grounded theory
    - Axial coding of the events
        + How does the position come to be
* Theoretical coding/findings of concepts
    - The important role of politics in actors taking a position
        + Taking positions to improve relations with relevant actors
        + Taking positions to influence processes
        + Taking positions to counteract adversaries
    - That is why the whole fake news thing works so well
    - You can only win on an issue, you cannot win the culture war

## Findings

* Presenting key moments as examples that we have found across repeated samples of KXL process
    - Laws/regulations as means, not ends
        + This is an opportunity to talk about fossil fuel firms influencing policy
        + Fossil fuel companies/intermediaries pushing for/designing laws to help with construction
        + Examples 
            * LB1161 episode
            * Trump day one decision
            * ALEC anti-protest law
    - Other actors' position not according to merit, but according to other goals
        + This is an opportunity to highlight how the public is being influenced
        + Direct examples:
            * Police harassing protesters because fossil fuel companies compensate police action for pipelines
                - Generating a narrative of protesters behaving criminally/being anti-police/worthy of targeting
            * The activist-TransCanada-legislature alliance in Nebraska, coincidental, different actors different reasons
                - This is a bit trickier to explain, but it is a (failed?) attempt of signaling a compromise on environmental issues to the public
            * Hillary
                - She is the epitome of this, although not on the side of TransCanada. An example for susceptible many relevant actors with a following are to influence tactics.
        + Indirect effect of this
            * The physical reality of facing opposition from TransCanada, the governor, and the police is enough to dissuade activists from blocking KXL. Or at DAPL, there were traumatic experiences in the Battle on Standing Rock, that make it more difficult for many, especially women, to continue their activism. 
                - Women took a more prominent role as water warriors, but are also more susceptible to mental trauma from physical violence.
    - For adversaries of KXL, they need to continually take counterposition, play the long game to be able to challenge KXL
        + Environmental groups that lobbied Clinton
            * To succeed in swaying her, they needed to oppose her for very long, which weakened her and may have contributed to her failure
            * They could not support and had to publicly oppose her for the entire duration
        + In Nebraska, opposing KXL was a years-long process across many arenas, required a lot of follow-up. These activists had no resources and could have given up at any moment for personal reasons.
        + James Hansen, NASA director of Goddard Institute, had to step away from his academic role into the role of an activist to make headway against a specific project
    - Unintended consequences
        + Where fossil fuel companies become too bold, it backfires
            * LB1161 clearly backfiring
            * Trump approval of the pipeline only resulting in longer holdup in legal battle
            * TransCanada seeking to run KXL under higher pressure, greenlit by PHSMA but backfiring against swift permit approval
    - Bonus: Even though we are looking for events where there are undecided participants, the identity politics stuff is inescapable. Clearly, Rex Tillerson would move KXL forward. Clearly, Bernie Sanders would stand against it.
