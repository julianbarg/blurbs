## About

I am a fifth year PhD student, completing my thesis and about to enter the job market this summer.

## Motivation

There are one specific concerns that motivated me to apply for the PhD Workshop. I am originally from Hamburg, and after finishing my PhD I will be looking for faculty positions in Northern Europe. I have great support from my two advisors, therefore I am less concerned about questions such as how do I advertise my research and theoretical fit at the moment. I am aware that the job market in Europe is different from the one in North America, but I hope to learn about the specific workings of it. For references, I am most interested in placements in Scandinavia, the Netherlands, the UK, Germany, and Austria.

## Constructing and Deconstructing an Environmental Threat

On January 20, 2021, the very day Joe Biden took office as the American president, he issued the "Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis". The order contains six broad policy decisions--and one very specific one: TransCanada’s construction permit for Keystone XL is revoked. The Keystone XL pipeline was supposed to be TransCanada’s follow-up project to the Keystone pipeline which transports diluted bitumen from Alberta, Canada to Texas. Construction began in April 2020, after the permit was issued in 2019. The order revoking TransCanada’s permit refers to a 2015 review of Keystone XL by the Department of State which found the pipeline to have a negligible economic impact, while posing a significant threat to the environment [@DOS2015].

On the surface, the revocation of TransCanada’s permit looks like a late victory for the environment. Keystone was built and Keystone XL began construction, but America finally came around. After an extensive discourse, the concern for the environment has come to dominate. For the oil and gas industry, the defeat of Keystone XL is highly symbolic and "may signal the end of major U.S. oil infrastructure" [@Freitas2021]. In other words, Keystone XL represents an important step toward the deinstitutionalization of pipelines through discourse [cf. @Maguire2009].

However, doubt should remain: How robust is the new status quo? Many actors continue to stand behind TransCanada. There are those who are directly or indirectly employed by the industry, and those studying subjects with deep ties to resource extraction, such as geology or engineering. And there are the communities for which oil & gas offers livelihood and identity--in an age where more oil can be extracted by less hands, maybe more of the second than the first. The three states that Keystone XL was supposed to cross never withdrew support for the project--TransCanada was at all time able to obtain all necessary permits at the state level. On the national level, the Koch family foundations, the American Petroleum Institute, and individuals from the oil & gas industry such as ExxonMobil CEO turned Secretary of State Rex Tillerson continue to hold a lot of sway and lobby for the interests of the industry.

My thesis studies the pipeline industry in the context of the cultural war that is being fought between environmentalists and proponents of the oil & gas industry. The second study, my job market paper, focuses on Keystone XL. The cultural war has for the most part remained a war of words but it has a distinctly physical dimension that is best exemplified by the 2016 Battle at Standing Rock related to the Dakota Access Pipeline. Sustainability scholarship conventionally focuses on a "cleaner" vision of progress that follows either from "enlightened" individuals inside of organizations [e.g.,@Howard-Grenville2017], or from economic motives [e.g.,@Flammer2015]. The oil & gas industry holds an antithetical vision, where progress follows from economic development, and resource extraction is an economic necessity. Here, the OT literature can contribute with its rich body of works analyzing social process--think organizations and institutions, networks, and power [@Davis2015; @Ergene2020].

### Studies

This section introduces three studies that are designed to generate research insights from the frail progress on the deinstitutionalization of oil and gas that is exemplified by the revocation of the permit for Keystone XL. The remainder of this document, after a brief summary of the quantitative data I have collected on the industry, focuses on the qualitative methods and data for the second study. The studies draw on institutional theory and organizational learning. Institutional theory is useful for explaining the stability of the current structure, and the challenges around substantial (as opposed to symbolic) change [@Meyer1977; @Hoffman2015]. Organizational learning on the other hand emphasizes the potential for adaption, knowledge sharing, and vicarious observation, while keeping one eye on obstacles [@Madsen2010; @Madsen2018; @Rerup2021].

Underlying all three studies is the understanding I have briefly developed above: that the polarization of the discourse on oil and gas has not been overcome by the defeat of Keystone XL. That the recent institutional developments in this area are characterized by twists and turns. And most importantly, that we should pay more attention to pipeline projects such as Keystone XL as potential precursor of the deinstitutionalization--or resurrection!-- of oil and gas, and "expect the unexpected".
The first study focuses on the industry side of the discourse. The operation and construction of pipelines requires a social license. The US experiences over 100 significant 1 pipeline spills every year. 2 Pipeline operators routinely make references to technology--both clean-up technology, and pipeline safety technology--in their statements on recent pipeline spills. Since both the quality of implementation and effectiveness of these new safety technologies is highly opaque for external audiences, the risk of decoupling and symbolic adaption is high [@Wijen2014]. In other words, pipeline operators can use symbolic references to technology in conjunction with selective disclosure of information on spill causes as a means of greenwashing [@Lyon2015]. Study one explores the potential of technology as a device for greenwashing, using a mix of quantitative data on pipeline networks and spills, and qualitative descriptions of spill causes and responses.

The first study’s theoretical focus on greenwashing limits the analysis to only one side of a richer discourse. Five communities have participated in the discourse on Keystone XL: pipeline operators, environmental activists, political decision makers, local residents, and the scientific community. The second study opens up the blinds to provide the complete picture of this multivocal environment. Participants meet in public forums across multiple years [@Latour2005] and produce their own texts before and after, allowing us to repeatedly observe their beliefs, information exchange, and strategizing over time. [@Maguire2009] describe deinstitutionalization as a process of discourse and collective alteration of institutions. In the case of Keystone XL, we observe only a partial reconfiguration of knowledge networks, which leads to a frail deinstitutionalization of large oil and gas infrastructure projects [cf. @Latour1984]. Study two studies focuses on the different communities that participate in the discourse on Keystone XL [@Aronczyk2019; @KnorrCetina1999], and how their participation on the Keystone XL discourse affects their understanding of the environmental risks and impacts related to pipelines and fossil fuels. Finally, I develop a model of the social process of deinstitutionalization in a multivocal environment.

The third study is a theory paper that applies the insights from studies one and two to the theory on organizational and collective learning. Whether a pipeline operators can maintain their public license does not only depend on the accuracy of the representations of their assets that they share with their audience. Rather, their models of the world need to become shared across a sufficient share of audience members. The learning literature similarly emphasizes the social dimension of learning--think vicarious observation [@Madsen2018]. The literature distinguishes between two dimensions--reliability and validity [@March1991a]. Reliability describes how widely shared a model of the world has become. Validity describes how useful the model is for prediction and control [@Rerup2021]. Contrary to our intuition, models that are sub-optimal in terms of validity can become widely shared in the world [@Levitt1988]. The third chapter is dedicated to the theory of reliability and validity.
